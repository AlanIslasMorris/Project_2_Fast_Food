I had a normal transaction,  everyone was chill and polite, but now i dont want to eat this. Im trying not to think about what this milky white/clear substance is all over my food, i d*** sure am not coming back."

6,8,3 months ago,1 star,"If I  could give this location a zero on customer service, I  would. Pulled into drive through at 8:07 and placed a simple order. I order a regular hamburg and cookies. Once I paid and pulled up to the window to pick up, I  was told to pull up to the #1 space. I sat there and sat there and.........25 minutes later, no order. I  went in and no one was at the counter. I yelled ""hello"" three times. A young lady came up asking who was handling the front counter. A young girl appeared. To make this complaint shorter, I  showed my receipt and another 5 minutes later I got my order. There was another order with a drink sitting on the counter that never got to the person who ordered it. After getting home, I  had no regular hamburg but had cookies. Everyone, don't even bother going to this location again. It's a horrible experience every time as you can see by other reviews."

9,8,3 months ago,4 stars,"I'm not really a huge fan of fast food, but I have 2 teenage daughter's who enjoy McDs. The staff here is always friendly and ALWAYS get their orders correct. By far one of the best McDs I have ever been to. I always enjoy and appreciate quality service from quality people... and you'll definitely find it here. At least from the evening crew. Haven't been here during the day. My girls joke that I go here so often to get them food, that the staff is going to end up knowing me and having their order ready to go. Lmao Great people and excellent service. ï¿½ï"

11,8,6 months ago,2 stars,"We stopped by for a quick breakfast.  It was not crowded inside, but there was a pretty long drive thru.

Our order was supposed to have 3 food items and 2 drinks. They missed a food item. The lady ignored me when I told her.

My husband went to get it, she finished her task then handed it to him without a word or smile or anything."
12,8,6 months ago,1 star,"The morning crew seems fast and efficient. Night crew is a whole different experience, lines down the street, hour long waits. If this was a one time occurrence it wouldn't be so bad but this is a nightly problem. Beyond this the staff is so highly rude you leave wanting to crash your car through the building. Don't forget they will mistake your order almost every single time as well and serve it to you cold."
13,8,a year ago,3 stars,"Today, i was disappointed in that restaurant #11853 did not get me my FULL order, meaning I did not receive my condiments for my big breakfast with hot cakes. No butter, no syrup, and no utensils. Luckily this was a hiccup and not a regular thing. Oh, and the egg was half the size of the sausage."

15,8,2 months ago,2 stars,This was a dine in experience. The tables were all dirty & we did not get our food after waiting 35 minutes. Chicken sandwich was burnt.

17,8,2 months ago,1 star,The boy who attended me made me wait and when he saw that the drink was wrong he threw the bag of food at me with a grimace. So disappointed!
18,8,7 months ago,1 star,I am not happy at all today I went and bought 4 Strawberry Banana smoothies and and 2 hash browns and my smoothies tasted like straight ice and water smh. And I am very disappointed in there service my smoothie should never taste like that never especially the fact I bought it for not only me but my kids. I need someone to contact me from corporate or something. I am not happy at all waste of moneyï¿½
19,8,7 months ago,4 stars,The staff seems to always be different which makes ordering sometimes a little difficult because they are in a state of perpetual learning which can also lead to waiting a bit longer but the lobby is always clean as well as the bathrooms
20,8,10 months ago,1 star,"Can't believe experience with order taker. Went from drive thru and employee directly asks what do you want. He keeps rushing while taking order with no other cars placing order. We wanted to add one more item and asked for a minute. He keeps asking what else. When I said we are ready - no response. There were no other car placing order that time either. I told again we are ready. responded after a pause. Again what do you want... excuse me.. who talks to customers like this ??
I asked for his name to put a review and he flat out denied. I asked for receipt before handing my credit card. He swipes it and returns back my card. I m waiting for a receipt with my family in the car. He starts inputing another order on his tablet. Waited for sometime and then I waive my hand several times. He opens window and said you can get receipt from next window. Excuse me ??
Went to next window - picked up food, asked for Manager and got his name JAMAR. My receipt states 08/06/2022 7:20pm Order 05
I didn't want to complain but this was intolerable."
21,8,4 years ago,1 star,"Meh.. just meh. When I finally get the correct order, it is generally tasty. I'm a picky eater, and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like. Worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard, tedious at times though. I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly. I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back. I just don't go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong."
22,8,a month ago,2 stars,Just needed caffeine. The staff at the drive thru just shoved the drink in my hands. Not very professional.
23,8,8 months ago,1 star,"This is consistently the worst meal you will pay for. Microwaved nuggets, cold fries and a 30 minute wait. What more can you ask for? Dont go here ever! Your better off going hungry or giving the meal you payed for to the homeless by the donation box behind the drive thru."

31,8,9 months ago,2 stars,"This location is wack.
They will literally stop taking orders and make people sit in the parking lot for like 12 minutes until 3:00 a.m. so that they don't get to order dinner food anymore.
We have gone multiple times right after leaving the pinballz arcade just to sit in the parking lot in the Drive-Thru line waiting while they do nothing but wait for the order menu to change over.
Look McDonald's if I wanted a breakfast deluxe I wouldn't have shown up at 2:30 in the morning thank you."

33,8,a year ago,1 star,"Just spent 10 minutes waiting at this McDonald's . According to Google they're open 24/7. Finally we pull up to the window to see if anyone was there, sure enough one employee seated in the lobby and another at the window. She told me they were closed. Whoever these two are they need to be replaced. Get it together McDonald's. You're a corporate power house and you have a reputation to keep. One of the most unprofessional experiences I've ever had with fast food. 0/10 would not recomend this location."

45,8,a year ago,2 stars,"I ordered a Large fry buy after arriving to my destination I saw they did not fill the carton up.  They gave me a small portion for what I paid for.  This is not right and management needs to correct this.  Stealing from customers is plain wrong.  When ordering a large, they expect to get what should come in a large.  I noticed after my bad experience that your reviews are low.  In order order to create a good business, giving people an exceptional experience should be your goal not the opposite."

49,8,a year ago,1 star,"Normally this location does pretty good, but last night was absolutely ridiculous. I sat in the drive thru for almost an hour waiting to get my order taken, the line was wrapped almost TWICE around the building, and finally I gave up and tried driving up to the window to give them my order since i was next in line. When i got to the window, they told me they couldn't take it and I'd have to go back around. I told them I'd like to put in my order here since I've been waiting all this time, and they proceeded to still refuse and that it's my fault for waiting in the second lane that they claimed was closed and had a sign out. The second lane was open, and the ""sign"" they were talking about was a wet floor sign they had placed right next to the drive-thru menu. I told them the lane looked open from our side and they still proceeded to argue with me, and then slammed the drive thru window shut. I've never received such deplorable customer service in my life, and if any managers are reading this, I highly suggest firing the two workers from last night."

57,8,a year ago,1 star,I went to pick up food from the restaurant at late night through drive through. I was told to wait near the door and I will be getting the order but even after waiting 15 minutes no one came with the food. Orders are already assigned and even after coming through drive through it takes more than half an hour to get it which is not good. Lots of people behind me got the food but no one cared about the driver who is already waiting from long time. Thank you
58,8,a year ago,4 stars,"OPEN 24HRS all the darn time!!  If there are 24 hours in every day and then 7 days in a week then that means this place is open eleventeen million hours a year.  I dont even know how they find people to work here I mean how do they shower or brush their teeth or change clothes if they are always there.... I think I may have an idea: they are robots.  Or clones, like this example that's Dolly the sheep she's pretty hot NGL."

64,8,2 years ago,3 stars,They run out of fry containers and constantly forget sauces. The dining room is still closed for some reason so have fun getting back in line for a sauce. Sometimes the fries aren't great which is a huge part of McDonald's. Come on guys...
65,8,3 years ago,2 stars,They get an extra Star because their staff 8 of 10 have been polite. Drive through has issues. They constantly get order wrong. Ask you to pull forward to fix and leave you hanging. I have had to go in twice to see why I am still sitting after five minutes. They are new. I understand training new people. But when you place an order and they repeat it back correctly and it comes out wrong or you have to repeat 3 times to make sure they get it right. Someone inside needs to make sure they are reading the whole ticket. Not just a quarter pounder. Especially with the multi menu choice of adding bacon or lettuce and tomatoes. Their tea as of late has tasted like dish soap and their fountain drinks have a funky taste to them. Numerous times their fries have been under cooked.

I know this isnt McDonald's fault, but when I called McDonalds to try and address the issue, they answered and then ignored me and must have left their phone off the hook because any attempt to call them after this got me only dial tone. I know places are short staffed, but you cant just ignore people."

However, if you love to be consistently let down, this particular location is the place to frequent. This location loves to give you incorrect items and 100% of the time your order will be missing something.

Please be sure to check your order prior to leaving the premises. Do note that it takes forever to get them to correct their mistakes, so do take into consideration that the rest of your food will be cold and soggy by the time"

80,8,3 years ago,4 stars,"I would have given 5 stars, the evening manager is the nicest person I have seen and is definitely in charge of training her crew with constantly new help, in spite of this, everytime I have to return an order she goes back to the kitchen and patiently disassembles the sandwich and explains the proper way to make the sandwich in a spirit of education and with a cherry disposition. You can tell the children she works with respect her and look up to her, and yes, they might get things confused occasionally but I will continue to go there. 4 out of 5 stars"
81,8,2 years ago,4 stars,"The staff is very kind and the food is usually prepared in a timely manner, for this reason it'sone of my preferred location's. However the drive thru line can sometimes be an inconvenience as it can get very long and at times even block entrances."

When asked for a manager the attendants lie and say that there isn't one on duty, FYI impossible for every shift not to have a manager. One specific attendant screamed and cursed at me, to which led me to contact corporate."
83,8,5 years ago,3 stars,"Decent McDonald's location.  The team here has always been friendly.  Drive thru can get pretty backed up during normal meal periods, so often it is better to go inside.  Make sure you go close to regular meal periods for fresher food vs the ones under the heat lamp for a while.    Store is always clean."

Today we went back to get our fry we had 3 chicken sandwiches and 2 fry not complicated at all. The manager gave us a new one but the girl at the oick up window shoved the bag in ny hands and when I tha ked her she made a rude face and turned away.

Also asked for 3 splendas and 4 creamers on the side and received 3 regular sugars and 2 creamers. To top it off, coffee was full of coffee grounds to the point I was spitting them out. And as a little plus there was a piece of plastic! Never again!"

It said it was 24 hour, however no one seemed to be taking orders and I drove around twice just in case and tried again but still no answer. I saw one employee in the kitchen but couldn't get his attention.   Very bad business. If closed or delayed in opening then at least a sign that indicates that would have been nice."

Corporate needs to send all their staff over to a week of training at chic-fil-A college to learn about work ethic, time management ,teamwork and basic manors.

""We can't do that"" seriously what kind of fast food place can't make fries? It only takes two minutes and 15 to heat up even the worst fryer. Which I would have waited for. Is this not the money making industry?

My business is now sitting at Whataburger who also doesn't have fries ready but said I could have some fresh in two minutes."

We ordered several different breakfast items and at the end my wife went to order a single order of three pancakes and sausage breakfast for one of the kids. At checkout it seemed expensive at first, the cashier never repeated the order back to us. When we received our order, we figured out why. She put us down for three total three pancakes and sausage breakfasts. When my wife brought it up the girl behind the register just said ""oops, sorry"" and walked away, no offer to fix it or give a refund. Great job."

108,8,5 years ago,1 star,"I didn't used to mind this McD's.  I was happy there was an option for 24-hr food in case I wanted something on the way home from a night out with friends or just late-night munchies.  During the day, it's a pretty average McD's.  But they lost my business forever when I went by one night at 1am, pulled up to the order box, waited for five minutes, then finally someone came over the speaker and said ""Sorry we're closed"".

Closed?!  It's 24-hrs!  And I get it, sometimes 24-hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning.  I get that, I really do.  But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so you're not blind-sided by it.  Not this place.  I really don't think they were closed.  I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing.

Additionally, this store has a bad habit of having a ""broken"" ice cream machine past 10pm.  It's always ""sorry, ice cream machine is broken"" if you come in after the lobby closes.

The worst part is I complained on the website.  I submitted a complaint for this store, pointing out the 24-hr and the ice cream issue.  All I got back (weeks later) was ""oh, sorry the ice cream machine was broken, we're working to upgrade all our locations but it takes time""  Not even a single MENTION of the ""closed"" 24-hr location.

As I said, it's a pretty standard McD's... which is synonymous with lazy, but this one takes the cake on it."

112,8,4 years ago,2 stars,We went through the drive-through and ordered 2 bacon-cheese burgers and 2 big Mac's and we asked for them to leave the middle part (the bread in the center). We got the bacon-cheese burgers and they were fine. But the big Mac's not only still had the bread in the center but had another piece of bread on the bottom with mac-sause on them. So instead of 2 pieces of meat and 2 pieces of bread I ended with 2 pieces of meat and 4 pieces of bread. I was not amused when I got home. You can bet that I will NOT EVER stop there again.

The burger that I got slopply made and the meat was half way hanging out of the burger and it was so bad that it was almost dry. My little boy was so upset that he doesn't want to here any more.

He told me that everyone there has passed their certification and if I don't like it I can go to the health department.  I have made a complaint with the  Texas health department. Floors are disgusting, bathrooms are disgusting!  This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to in my life and I have traveled all over this country."

And there is always something missing in my order. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
127,8,7 years ago,1 star,"The inside smells like baby diapers. When you ask for extra sweet and sour sauce they give you a dirty look like it is such a hassle.

It seems as if 3 time a week we get bad tea from this location. It's not like we can just leave work to go get a new one either. We send my hubby on a drink run in the morning and he constantly forgets to take the ""taste test"" before he leaves, but he should not have to!"

But im in a rush this morning. So i get to the window after showing the pic they still say so you want 2 and 1 extra? Oh i snapped. Then i asked how much is one hashbrown. He said $1 ohhhh i snapped lol so the deal is you get to pay a extra $1 for 2 ? So i just said give me 3 $ hashbrowns. Then they said its tax.. I wanted to jump out of my brand new suv .. Lol i now see why they have those videos of people jumping on fast food workers! So i gave them my card and call the manager and he was just as smart as them. Armando said we do have sandwiches for $3. I almost threw my phone. I said i never asked you about a sandwich i said hashbrowns. Smh then i just said good bye sir you'll be hearing from me again. But really wants the use. I made that bad decision

143,8,4 years ago,3 stars,Meh! It's McDonald's what can I say you get what you pay for. Don't expect the place to be clean or the employees to be over the moon with courtesy. Like I said you get what you pay for. This is not a bad review it's just a Meh review because it's McDonalds. It's not like you're eating at a five-star Resort and getting a massage afterwards. However if McDonald's does decide one of these days to start serving alcohol I might have to pay it another visit. I don't go to McDonald's often. I only stopped in out of convenience. Like I said this is not a bad review to disrespect McDonald's in any way.

145,8,5 years ago,5 stars,Understand McDonald's is under construction but it is doing well with its Service as it's going right now I still recommend going to McDonald's is still fast service and still great awesome food and the kids love it still so as soon as they're done with the remodeling as soon as they are they are they're all right all day all ready to go back to work I recommend this in my community and Community sure does love this and Leander Texas
146,8,4 years ago,4 stars,Live nearby and this is our choice McDonald's compared to others in close distance. I gotta say though that the last order of fries I got really were so yucky I chewed on 2 and didnt eat the rest. They tasted over cooked or double cooked. Something made them rubbery and inedible to me.

649,14,7 months ago,1 star,"Horrible customer service! Ordered 2 large fries. They had so much salt on them they were inedible! had to be thrown out . There was even salt on my front car seat! Looked like employee dumped an entire box of salt on them! I live 15 miles away. Took pictures to show manager ""Bridgit"" next time I returned.  She would not make good! Zero stars!"
650,14,3 weeks ago,1 star,"Not only did my whole family and I wait on the drive through line for more than 20min but the fact that my burger came in a weird ate out way and the fries were salty soggy, and disgusting. NEVER again will I spend my money here with this type of food and service during the night hours."
651,14,2 months ago,4 stars,"Not worth the effort to get in and out of construction to wait for old food.
Only went there twice. The food is never fresh.  Chicken sandwich was shriveled and dry like it had been sitting for hours after being over cooked to begin with. There was a small drop of mayo on it and the bun was stale. First time I figured was a one off but the second time I ordered 20 nuggets and fries and a milkshake.  They didn't give a receipt then told me to go park to wait for the food to be ready.  There were no spots open that I could access and the cashier just said 'do whatever' and walked away.  I waited for the car in front of me to move so I could pull around the building and get into a spot but asked first about my shake.  She said they'll bring it.  Waited a few min honestly not long but then they forgot my milkshake and asked me very curtly 'well do you have a receipt? ' clearly not.  Eventually they brought out the shake but fries were old and cold and the shake was melted."
652,14,2 years ago,5 stars,"I used the drive thru today.
It was quick.
Free off street parking lot.
Building was clean and well maintained.
To pay the clerk put the card reader outside so I could put my own card in the machine.
Safe I guess?
Food was typical McDonald's food. Good
Warm. Not Hot.
Had #9 Large with a Diet Coke.
2 Cheeseburgers and FF
And a LG Soda."
653,14,a month ago,1 star,No one cares about walk-ins anymore. Staff only give all of their attention to the drive-through. Can't even dine in anymore. My kids had to wait nearly 5 min just to ask for ketchup. Everyone was in the back and by the drive-through window.

655,14,3 months ago,1 star,Ordered early with a mobile app to have waited for 30 minutes for a breakfast sandwich. I was on a 15 minute work break . Enough said. Incompetent staff built by children. Neglected store with absolutely neglected issues. My soda didn't even have flavor in it.
656,14,a year ago,5 stars,Location was clean and modern. Staff were frienldy and efficient. What stood out here the most was the quality of the food preparation. It was almost as if I made it myself and it tasted great. Prices were good too. Highly recommend.
657,14,7 months ago,1 star,awful service fries were cold cheese burger was cold and now they charge for honey mustard. donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï
658,14,a month ago,1 star,My food sucked. My french fries were cold and only half full. Not to mention that they charged me 25 dollars and had to wait 20 minutes. What rip off.
659,14,5 months ago,3 stars,"Food came out at different times for a dine in. Then it was wrong sandwich like usual for a McDonald's. But what put this over the top was the employee's. 1 female worker came out screaming somebody stole $200 from her purse, then the manager acted like  she wasn't even there. Extremely wrong way to act or even pose as a manager. Then the Boyfriend came in of the victim employee and they called the cops on him because he demanded his girlfriend money to be rightfully returned. Meanwhile 2 other employee's stated that they had money stolen from the as well over the last few weeks. Definitely not a well run establishment or managed. I'd highly recommend not eating inside this place. And keep yourself locked in your car. You might get robbed by an employee."
660,14,a year ago,1 star,They looked so gross from the start. They weren't even warm. They taste just as bad as they look. I also got a quarter pounder. Cheese is half on and half off the sandwich. The only good thing was the fries.
661,14,6 months ago,2 stars,"Curbside is unavailable for all hours.
McDonald's app freezes in order screen frequently at this particular location...,I have great service with AT&t and new phones so I don't think it's on my end.
I have had multiple issues with old orders trying to reprocess old orderss here ,& leading to wrong food being ready at the window staff more interested in proving to me that what came through from the app was what they prepared. 4 chicken nuggets for three people.

674,14,9 months ago,2 stars,Sorry to rate you a two but just 12 years ago you would of been rated a five. You changed your fries and they are thinner and not as good and when you got a spicy chicken sandwich it was a spicy patty and came with lettuce and tomato now it is a crispy chicken patty with spicy sauce and pickles where is the lettuce and tomato oh you have to order a deluxe.  You are getting cheaper with the food and the prices go up. Not pleased very disappointed.

The drive thru worker was distraught as I gave back 1st one made wrong. Another employee finished order, by running out to car. I questioned the workers about the cost & size of my drink (all 3 said it was med size - turned out to be a SMALL) & they ""got me"" a few weeks ago on that. Girl who ran out order was ONLY ONE who acted professionally & provided great customer service. SADLY, the iced coffee prices are low because drink is so small, if they could charge a fair price they would have a new regular! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"

Bun for the Quarter Pounder was stale and loaded with a lot of big, thick onions!!! Had to throw most of onions away!!! Average experience nothing to brag about though!!!"

685,14,11 months ago,1 star,Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Staff was rude and disinterested and playing around with each other and getting drinks and walking around outside while customers waited forever for food. All booths were dirty and the chicken nuggets were exceptionally inedible. Almost like they were dropped in oil twice to be reheated. I had to give a star to write a review otherwise they would've gotten a zero.

I used the Mobil app but still had to pay when I went to the window and was offered no reasonable explanation. Took twenty minutes for them to serve three cars.

702,14,a year ago,3 stars,Salads are not sold there anymore and neither are grilled chicken sandwiches but I think that is common in many McDonald's now. I'm gluten free so a salad would have been nice for lunch today. Won't be going back there anytime soon.

They deserve it they have proven it to us over and over again..  The New Manager (wish I knew her name) has taken this location from a zero/0 stars to getting a rating of Five/5 Stars and I know that it could not have been easy. I have picked up dinner her once a week for 8-9 weeks in a row and the FOOD has been great.  Thats a lot considering its a McDonald's. My food when I picked it up was always hot, all the food was there correctly. Everything was well made and put together.  You can tell the new manager has set the standards extremely high at this location and the employees have responded extremely well for her. She deserves a big hand for caring about her staff and customers.
Thank You for Caring.......
Great job!!   Well done!!!!!"

712,14,3 years ago,5 stars,This McDonald's in wind gap has a manager who cares about the customer and about placing a good product out for the customer. The staff there is always friendly and helpful. They also make sure you get your burger how you want it and stacked properly so you can eat it without a big mess in your hands and let's not forget about the hot fries. I have heard her tell her employees to make sure people get hot fries. Nobody does that except for her.  That's why this is the best McDonald's.

714,14,4 years ago,2 stars,"Food was alright. Wasn't really hot and my husband's bagel was stale. But it was...ok. I guess.

The place was trashed. Not one clean table and garbage everywhere, yet we were the only ones in the place the whole time we ate and very few people were going through drive thru. There were two managers on...no one thought to clean? Can't blame it on being busy...

Cashier was new and a bit rude. We ordered three meals. She rang everything up separate but left off our hash browns. Manager made us pay to get our hash browns. Forget that it was all way more expensive cause of how she rang it up to begin with...then the cashier kept telling the manager in front of us that we never said we wanted meals, even though when I repeatedly told her we wanted meals she kept saying ""sure I can make that a meal for you.""

Completely unprofessional and we left feeling disgusted by the whole experience."
715,14,3 years ago,1 star,I went through the drive-through and ordered a double Mac meal. I received a single Mac meal And the food was cold. I drove away and call back and told  Them  my meal was wrong. The manager tells me on my next visit I will receive a complimentary order. NO how about giving me the right order or given me my money back. I gave this McDonald's the benefit of Benefit of the doubt is not my 1st Bad Experience in this McDonald's. But it will be my last as I will never visit this McDonald's again.
716,14,2 years ago,1 star,"This McDonald's is the worst in my opinion.   Tonight they forgot the sauce, fries were stale as usual.   Called corporate a few times and they are nice but this McDonald's needs an overhaul on how they do busines . Each time I feel ripped off."

She hung up on me after I asked her to have the car in front of me pull up so I can get my meal and leave. When I got to the window, she not only disrespected me but she cursed me out and yelled at me. That is NOT a form of respect especially to a customer and not only that, the ENTIRE staff was fooling around and not getting any of their work done. Very unprofessional and needless to say, I felt very disrespected and disgusted. I have NEVER been treated in such a more disgusting way than this team that was on today.

Like review I did on the Hamlin MCDonalds, I call this the older style and it's been [ainted over the years and they removed the small playyard it had.  People now are a afraid of ballpits and it was outside so it didn't get used over 6 months of the year.

There is ample seating, but I've seen more with more seating, but we've never been without finding a seat.  Everything is pretty clean and in good order. Walk-in orders are accurate and fast.  Drive in is fast and about 8 times out of 10 they will have it exact.  Some times they get it wrong, but like we say nobody's perfect.

Since it's right on Rt209 it's easy to get in and out of unless your traveling South on 209 then sometimes it's hard to pull out because there's KFC and Subway and an Ice Cream shop across the street so it's a busy little area in Brodheadsville.  Overall it's a nice facility."

Have been to this McDonalds about a dozen times the past couple years, and literally every single time I've been there, they have screwed something up. These people can't even count FFS, as they gave me TWO crispy tenders in my four piece. It's mind-boggling.

Not to mention, they are ALWAYS out of at least one item I order, and the drive-thru involves pulling off and waiting for 10-15 minutes every single time, even if there is no one in the place. Complete and utter disgrace."
732,14,2 years ago,4 stars,"Wind Gap, PA location was surprisingly better during COVID 19 because with the interior closed, the drive up was fast and serving fresh food.
The streamlined way allows  serving just the drive up and so, the kitchen staff cooks food for just one area. Probably saves on staff hours.

The grease from the burger had absorbed into the bread so much that I squeezed the bread and grease dripped from it. The frys were not at all fresh. I threw my meal in the trash where it belonged. Called the store and spoke with John. He apologized and took my name down and I will get a refund but it doesnt help my hunger NOW. Worst encounter with McDonalds ever.

746,14,4 years ago,4 stars,"Always consistantly good food at a good price. I like the breakfast choices. The fries are the best of any fast food restaurant period. I've read articles, how they selectively choose and then sign contracts with potato farmers to insure the quality and taste is maintained throught all the locations. I wish they would deep fry the apple pies as they did years ago, they were the best when fried. Good service, always have the food choices in stock. clean seating area, kitchen, and bathrooms Enjoy."
747,14,3 months ago,3 stars,They got 2 out or 3 wrong
748,14,4 years ago,1 star,"Worst mcdonald's around.  Workers are rude and the orders are always wrong. And don't even think about complaining. Because they will get in your face and curse at you. Very unprofessional. Don't waste your time going there, food is cold, most of the time, or you're missing an item. Needs to be shut down."
749,14,2 years ago,4 stars,Nice to sit inside after 2years. The tables didn't look sanitized after people had eaten  I could see grease and crumbs left behind  Also very disappointed they have no salads
750,14,3 years ago,1 star,"By far the worst of the franchise. This location does not sell McDonald's recipes or guidelines. 2 times i made a u-turn for over salted fries that can't be eaten for the amount of salt put on them. The burgers are not built to McD recipes they appear slopped together and backwards. To top it off the packing is without care. They mix multiple orders in different bags where another petson has to dig food out of another bagto putmy meal together. This is serious ignorance, laziness and incompetence management to say the least! Need more prople to contact corporate about this location..."
751,14,2 years ago,5 stars,Evening shift gave us warm fresh food.Surroundings/parking lot was Very clean. To top it off we got a super great Window person.
752,14,5 years ago,1 star,"According to both Google and the corporate website the drive thru at this location is 24 hours. I have gone there multiple times recently to find cars parked in the lot, lights on in the building, and the drive thru signs lit only to wait several minutes with no acknowledgment. I even pulled around to the window and honked and still received no response."
753,14,4 years ago,1 star,Staff was very courteous about the long wait. Management is responsible for the situation. Shouldn't have to wait 15 minutes for fast food at 8:40 am. Not the first time.
754,14,8 months ago,5 stars,"They are very polite, quick and the food is good."
755,14,a year ago,2 stars,"The bun was dry, the fries weren't the same. I'll pass! But the Hi-C orange was good."
756,14,3 years ago,2 stars,It's McDonald's for the love of God get the order right 1st of all 2nd of all put some napkins and utensils in the bag salt and pepper wouldn't kill you what apparently don't go to the drive-through because you orders not gonna get done right and egg mcmuffin should not look like to sources rig muffins then you go inside and it takes you another 20 minutes to get U dam order it's McDonald's for the love of God just pay attention I understand the pool that you have to pick from for help is very thin and limited

760,14,a year ago,2 stars,"Time for McDonald's to open their doors for indoor seating.
Pricing is getting out of hand as well.  Can go to red Robin for $5 more and sit down to eat."
761,14,5 years ago,2 stars,This place is always so slow. Went through the drive-thru with only 3 cars in front of me. Took 20 minutes to get my food and they had four drinks prepared on the counter but mine wasn't one of them. Almost charged me for the wrong order too since they don't seem to be able to keep track of them well.
762,14,a year ago,2 stars,The lobby is open but you stand there for quite some time before your order gets taken. All attention is on drive thru
763,14,a year ago,4 stars,I went through the drive-through or two chicken nuggets and a root beer with no ice the chicken nuggets with ice cold and the rupiah had a double lid on it and when I drink it spilled about a third of it on my shirt it wasn't properly put in place
764,14,11 months ago,1 star,Location has gone down hill the night workers are super inconsistent and lazy. They manage to take the persons order behind me before me and then never took my order. I pulled around to order and they told me to go back around after waiting for 15 mins. Donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
765,14,a year ago,4 stars,"Pretty good food, I always get mcflurries, they never have a broken machine and if they do I've never had an encounter with it."
766,14,2 years ago,1 star,"You used to be able to get multiple Travis Scott special at a discount.  Now the J. Balvin Special is one per downloaded app to get the McFlurries for free.  All other orders are at 12 dollars a pop, u need to check ur order.  Short on fries and the McFlurries were half filled.  Totally disappointed."
767,14,2 years ago,1 star,"Pretty much the worst McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve ever had, and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
768,14,3 weeks ago,3 stars,Not bad
769,14,4 months ago,1 star,5 cars pulled over waiting for orders. Suddenly a burger and fries is too hard.
770,14,a year ago,4 stars,Staff was great food was  a little  old but what do expect from mcdonalds? This is why we don't eat there often.
771,14,2 years ago,5 stars,Ppl are great. They take pride in their workand they get special orders correct. Always pleasant. You can never get tired of kind and friendly service and they are open 24hrs. Yay to McDonald's!

776,14,3 years ago,1 star,Terrible as usual. 1 out of 10 when it comes to getting a good meal.  Slow slow slow service.  Stale fries again. Worst McDonald's in the area.  Terrible fries as usual. Feel ripped off.
777,14,2 years ago,1 star,Of the fries we got they were cold. The small bad had about 10 if that. They did not add the ranch or BBQ sauce that we asked for. Horrible!

781,14,a year ago,1 star,Worst customer service ever will not return. Food was cold and frys not cooked properly. Bread had mold on it
782,14,4 years ago,5 stars,"To McDonald's which has changed drastically for the better. You can have breakfast all day long. Breakfast very large for onky $6 something had scrambked eggs, hash brown sausage patty , biscuit and 3 pancakes. New Quarter Pounder has been made up differently with lettuce and tomato now. Still a great place to go low costs and good quality."
783,14,5 years ago,3 stars,good food BUT they need to be more careful at the drive thru- Forgetting parts of an order when someone doesn't live in direct vicinity can be a real hassle.
784,14,3 years ago,3 stars,"I've been coming here for years, but this was the first time they screwed up my order.  I would give it a higher rating if they didn't take out the play area."
785,14,8 months ago,1 star,the staff is unbelievably rude and we had to wait 30 min for assistance #hurd

798,14,6 years ago,2 stars,The Google info says open 24 hours. It's not. Pulled up at 530am and just sat to use wifi. After a little while the morning crew came in and out up cones on all the parking spots near me. It was very strange.
799,14,a year ago,3 stars,Biscuits are still tasty. Portions are smaller.  Prices are higher.
800,14,3 years ago,3 stars,"Mornings are their best time, anytime when lunch starts after expect your order to be screwed up even if it's only 2 sandwiches. Happens every to every other time but it's the only McDonald's around us."

806,14,6 years ago,2 stars,The food handlers were picking up the plastic bag of shack mix with gloves off of the FLOOR on then going back to food handling. You've got to be kidding me. What are you wearing gloves for?
807,14,4 years ago,1 star,Waited literally 10 minutes for a steak egg and cheese bagel. Would of rather went to Wawa and it would of been faster and healthier.
808,14,7 months ago,1 star,Restaurant 42 the worst and the dirtiest trays that they put your food on that I've ever seen complained about it before and nobody has done anything about it as of yet so if it's restaurant 42eat at your own risk so if you're looking for a place to eat at McDonald's ask if it's restaurant 42 before you orderthey tell me tell me to come back and you'll make it right how's it going to do that when  they don't know it's me coming back
809,14,5 years ago,3 stars,"Just okay food; nothing spectacular.  Chicken was bland and not seasoned enough.   Also, meat was on the skimpy side considering the chicken dinner is $10 and Chivo (or goat) is $14!"
810,14,a year ago,5 stars,"Staff at this location are always friendly, and the food is hot and fresh."
811,14,3 years ago,3 stars,"For a fast food burger,  the quarter  pound deluxe was actually pretty good. Not like back yard grilling, decent."

831,14,3 years ago,5 stars,Only place for miles with a restroom that alone demands a 5 Star rating. Aside from that it's your typical McDonalds.

1249,34,4 months ago,3 stars,Ordered a steak bagel during breakfast through drive-thru. I had a very long wait. The bagel was good and was as expected from a McDonald's. My experience having to wait a while is about 50/50 at this location.
1250,34,4 months ago,5 stars,This location is always running no matter what time or day. The food is always fresh and the service is usually fast. If they ever mess your order up they usually do right by you and give you a fresh new order. This location was renovated recently so everything is brand new. They no longer have the children's play area but it's much more of a sit in restaurant style McDonald's.

1252,34,3 weeks ago,4 stars,"Our visit was on Friday, 5/12/2023. There is a marked improvement in the service and cleanliness at this location on Ft. Hamilton Parkway. Katherine, the Manager, and her staff (Chris) promptly offered help and solutions to my family's needs. The use of a dedicated staff member to continuously clean the dining area was a big plus. I only feel that the beverage station should be closer to the dining area to facilitate the transfer of drinks from station to table; particularly for the disabled.
Another, concern was the price of the food. Though there were ""dollar"" options available, the price of the more popular sizes and items was very high. A median-income family of four would be wary of dining more than once a month, if that often.
The name of the counter person that helped us during our visit was Chris. He is a credit to the McDonalds company."

1255,34,2 months ago,1 star,"I placed a mobile order when I was at the McDonald's at 72-69 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, NY 11367. I placed that order on March 29, 2023 at 07:48:29 PM. This order should be brought to table 101. The McDonald app said that in 2 or 5 minutes, somone will bring my order. I waited for 15 minutes. I still did not see my order at table 101. I went to the counter and asked for it. A lady saw a tag with 101 on the counter and then she prepared for my order, and then gave it to me. I asked her why no one brought me the order. She did not say. Then, I asked for the manager. Then, a gentleman named Armando showed up. I told him what happened. He first told me that they were busy. However, there was no one waiting at the counter. I told the manager that the lady who prepared my order saw my order tag on the counter. Then, the manager changed his explanation. He said that after 7 PM, they don't serve table service. In other words, they don't bring order to the table after 7 PM. I said that the Mcdonald's app says that the table order is still available. Then, he said that every store is different. I doubt what he said. This is bad servcie and bad responses from the store manager. The manager lied."

But I tried to explain there was so much oil everywhere that when I tried to pick up the burger it slips right out of my hand and the oil is spilling everywhere. Even when I got a new burger she still insisted on justifying why it was like that instead of apologizing to a customer.

According to them there was nothing they could do then.  They refused to refund me for the missing food from my order.  I guess if they don't pack the food you paid for properly it's your problem?  Not a great way to do business."

1292,34,a year ago,2 stars,Always very disappointing. I've gone to this McDonald's for 15 years now. The system has gotten more organized since the recent renovation but it seems the efficiency still has not improved. The workers are nice and willing to help. The seating area is much better. The biggest issue would be the lack of efficient service. I've seen people leave after ordering because it would take so long. Hopefully it'll be improved.

Straws have either been paper or plastic. They do not include ketchup packets, so you have to ask counterstaff. $1 drinks is a perk that no other fast food restaurant has. The dining room has plentiful tables and chairs too, ranging from booths to high stools to couch-like chairs. Easy to get there by Q25 or Q34. Not very close to any subway stations."

What's wrong with the girl cashier tan skin, black hair, the Hispanic or Indian girl with the yellow long press on nails?! Im sure you can single her out of the crowd. I wont say her name even though they all kept saying eachothers names out loud like it was high school musical back there. Is it mandatory for her to not give me my receipt? I , like many other hardworking Americans who have been coming here for as long as we all can remember,  need a receipt; especially just incase how fast food workers forget to give us all of our order.. and wouldn't you know it, not only did they fail to give me my receipt,  but they failed to give me the correct order. I asked for my order more than three times! Is it also part of the owner's of McDonald's policy to berate the customer in Spanish? I'm Puerto Rican and I understand everything they was saying. How rude to have said all of that in front of the customer,  and about the customer.  Is this how you value your rewards members? I'm going to post about my experience on any social media platform! Mark my words! I would also like to state that the woman manager allowed her staff to keep acting maliciously and she acted as if nothing was going wrong. Is this how you run your establishment?!
The African American fellow, tall, with a kind of lisp, gave me again the wrong order and the wrong receipt. Must be nice to pick out the garbage a receipt from three hours ago to give to me, thinking i wouldnt know the difference! The owner should pop on in!! Must Like losing out on money.

1333,34,a year ago,2 stars,"I like the convenience of this McDonald's for  parking and drive thru,  the food is fresh and the place is clean,though I think because of the Covid increase they don't let anybody sit inside. My problem is the workers organization. Nobody is at the register or someone to help you at the kiosk. One kiosk machine did not give you a receipt, another gives you just a white paper. Long wait to pick up order, took like 20 minutes. Once you get your order it is missing items from your order. Today, I was missing hashbrowns. I also ordered hot chocolate with caramel and I got coffee  instead. I did not change it because two weeks ago, the same thing happened and I had to wait 20 more minutes for them to give me the hot chocolate. I thought that was an isolated incident but it happened again today. For this reason I'm not coming back to this place ever again. Goodbye!!!"

Or why no one can help you at drive thru apparently it would work if you walk into the store??? No you should get a manager or someone who wants to help instead of people telling you that your holding up their line. As far as I though I was still a customer. Not everyone would like to go into the store especially with covid. Just learn to help people instead of treating people like cattle.

1392,34,4 years ago,2 stars,"Tl;Dr poor service, frequently gets orders wrong.

We try and avoid this place even when we specifically have a hankering for McDonald's. We always have an issue at this McDonald's no matter what time of day,  whether we order from a food delivery service or in person. The orders always get screwed up,  from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had cheese! If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby we'd probably never go here again.
But today I finally understood why it's a mess: there's no communication. It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Dr. Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other. Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one. Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink he'd just placed in the row of 8 other drinks he'd been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr. Pepper and he said yes...it was a Coke.
Management here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication, especially when it's busy. Yes it's just a McDonald's, and I'm not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint, but our community deserves better than what we're getting for sure."
1393,34,2 years ago,4 stars,"TLDR: You can get the BTS meal here - two sauces and special bag included.

Never thought I'd be writing a review for a McDonald's, yet here we are. Was disappointed to hear that the purple packaging isn't available in the U.S. (@Corporate: missed opportunity!). Hesitant because the paper bag adorned with the BTS logo was not guaranteed to be available at all locations. Fears were quelled, as I saw other guests sitting outside, and the elusive BTS paper bag going for $70+ on eBay was elusive no longer. Utilized the self-service machines to order - quick and easy. Medium and large sizes available (opted for medium, which was more than enough food in hindsight). Liked the Cajun sauce more than the Sweet Chili sauce, but just a personal preference. Total of the medium BTS meal was $8.39 + 0.74 tax = $9.13. Food was nothing special; just happy to support the boys.

As always, please be kind to food service workers.

Sometime my order will be ready in the bag, but they'll set it aside, and realize it much later, as I watch them complete other orders wondering why mine is taking too long, and it turns out my order was read all along, they just never bother to call the number.

1414,34,6 years ago,1 star,"Worst place ever! Young man on speaker does not listen to order and does not type it on the reciet all the time, girls in front are always lost and if something is written on the receipt they still don't read it. They also get annoyed when you ask for stuff to be fixed like more cream in coffee, or a sauce you did not which goes with the meal that was on the receipt, etc. Also very sloppy throw food in bag upside down like nuggets or tenders,  also don't wrap the sandwiches well and the papers all greasy, ketchup on top of fries. Always try to get orders out on an unrealistic timer ever for a fast food place and once that happens they close out the order and make you pull to the side to wait for food while 3, 4 people behind get to leave with there orders. It's ridiculous! Just give the whole order at the window this isn't a race and people everywhere else have to wait there turn to complete there orders and go. The weekend crew is even worse!"

It's getting a bit ridiculous for something like this to happen everytime i order. So no, I'm not happy."
1424,34,5 years ago,3 stars,"The food is okay when you're on the run. But I just walked into the men's room and had to run out. For an establishment that maintains a healthy profit, they absolutely need to update their 19th Century restroom accommodations. And come up with a maintenance schedule."

He took my order and he didn't even know the menu. Gave the wrong order..
And he talked nasty to customers.

I think  MacDonald's head quarters should go and check up on this place specially on give a  training to employees and managers in how to  give an excellent service. But this is not a plasent place to have a Burger..

Sorry, for me I let my money there.. Shame on you MacDonalds."

1435,34,5 years ago,1 star,I am giving 1 star because you can't give a half. I will start driving another 20 min away before I come here again. IF YOU GO THROUGH DRIVE THROUGH CHECK YOU'RE ORDER EVERY TIME 10 out of the last 10 times I did order was wrong. Small fries have more fries then the large. If you order a Big Mack you will either get no mac sauce or more sauce then meat and bread. The staff is horrible drive through sucks and even if you go inside you will have to return to counter atleast 3 times before you get everything. This McDonald's has been here for ever and has been going down hill for the last year.

#1 the area for the lines is small. So expect to be cramped when it's busy, and be confused as to where the lines are, and where they start.
#2 the employees are not friendly, I wouldn't say they're mean, but they obviously don't care about any pleasantries, or seem to care about you.
#3 there is no where in the store an area where you can grab napkins, or ketchup, or straws. You have to go up to the counter and ask them for packets and straws and utensils, during lunch time when lines are longer and it's getting congested at the counter, it makes it worse when people have to constantly come up to the counter and ask for something.

I don't recommend coming here if you want to stop and relax for food."

She said thats the only other option, I am charging you for a plain sundae.  I reiterated that a sundae is defined by ice cream with topping.  The cashier made me over pay for my ice cream in a cup.

That being said, numerous times I have been unable to understand the other person in the booth and they cannot understand me. Sometimes it is faulty intercom issues itself. But, often it is someone in the booth who does not understand or speak English properly! This is highly frustrating when I have to repeat my order as much as six times! Yeah, I said six times! Last weekend,  it was an Indian kid  who I could not for the life of me understand! And he could not understand me. A polite enough kid when I reached the booth, but seriously frustrating experience! Other times it's someone who does speak the language properly, or a close facsimile LOL but they are distracted by their phone. When I finally reach the booth to pay, often, and usually female LOL, the cashier is thumbing through her phone. McDonald's needs to set some standards for the people who work the drive thru. If you are face to face with a cashier with language issues, it's easier to deal with, but, Don't put these people on the Drive through intercom! By the way the food is just fine there. No issues on that end. LOL, work it out Mickey d!"

The waiting time is considerably ok based on the high volume of clients they serve, however I do recommend to check your order at the time receiving it in the counter. I didn't have any inconvenience, probably because I only order a coffee, but 5 min waiting time were enough to see several clients complaining for a missing item. I think I waited too much for a coffee, but I understand they were really busy. The coffee was good as usual."
2306,21,a year ago,5 stars,From cleanliness to freshness to the fast customer service 5/5 stars. Ordered online typed am here and voila order is called out.

A very unfriendly and rude guard sits table and he says, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yo close, yo close.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ However, two other customers were ordering using the kiosk. I tried to argue with him, but I just left because I didn't want to talk to a rude person. McDonald's is a big company. If they have cleaning hours, they must notify Google. This early hour should not cause customers to walk in vain to this place. They are wasting their customers' time and are not considerate. Because of these little things, McDonald's image"

McDonald's stores have a real problem with the homeless.

2315,21,4 months ago,1 star,At 2:34 pm 1/22/2023 the manager working there with the mole on her face made very racist remarks behind their back to the customers ahead of us and was very rude to me and my wife when asked for an extra straw since the paper straws never last. Disgusting behavior and attitude coming from a manager. 0/10 would not recommend.

2332,21,a year ago,4 stars,"Well staffed on the weekend. Clean and efficient service. Food is prepped on 2nd floor and ride conveyor down to be bagged. I don't like the idea of not being able to glimpse food preparation operation. However, service is good. Food tastes as expected. Standard, nothing special. Kind of small space. Fine to satisfy immediate hunger."

2334,21,2 years ago,1 star,This McDonald's has a sign posted open 24hrs but at 1:10 am they had ppl waiting outside with the doors close. Its cold and the staff is very unprofessional. I doubt the corporate office knows about this
2335,21,a year ago,5 stars,"This McDonald's is pretty okay, but at night junkies tend to wander around this area. Obviously not the restaurant's fault though it's worth noting. I always do app orders, and haven't had any issues in the past year or however long. The wait seems normal to me. I definitely prefer this location to the larger one on 8th Ave."
2336,21,10 months ago,5 stars,It was good. There was a mistake on my order it was fixed no problem. The machines were having some problems and this made the lines a little long. But it was fine.

2348,21,a year ago,4 stars,"I Rarely frequent McDonald's as a brand, but your beautifully remodeled location diagonal from Penn Station is the ONLY place you can get ice coffee and a breakfast sandwich at 5:30 in the morning! The staff that was on the first time I went where pleaser and efficient. The second time I went,I had to use the kiosk,which frustrated me ( I rather interact with humans) A young lady from the back came out to help me place my order,and I was an appreciative and satisfied customer that morning!"
2349,21,a year ago,4 stars,"Although this particular McDonald's is located in the heart of Manhattan, the service was very friendly just not very expeditious. The food was consistent with McDonald's Fair so I guess it was okay overall I mean it's McDonald's you going to like it or you don't and I'm sure most people that's reading this have at least visited one in the lifetime if not more and they're different depending on who you go to and what day but the food to be consistent if the food sucks everything about the experience sucks okay have a great day until my next one."
2350,21,a year ago,5 stars,"Did you know McDonald's has a special relationship with Coke and they have the freshest, crispest, tastiest Coke you can buy anywhere?  Try it and you'll see what I go just for Coke sometimes. All soda sizes are $1.00 right now."

Never had a problem here, the only annoying are the crazy aggresive homeless that sometimes go there. Other homeless are calmed and just ask for food outside."
2353,21,2 years ago,1 star,"Wanted to try their new crispy chicken sandwich on a potato roll & was so disappointed. I expected crispy but what u got was a burnt piece of chicken you could barely bite into, you could tell the same piece had been cooked several times that day. It was disgusting that they even served it to me like that. I took 2 bites & it went directly in the trash."

It looked like they had another level of seating but it was closed off for some reason."

2358,21,a year ago,5 stars,The restaurant was clean and inviting. The service was good (not great) and the food was hot and delicious.
2359,21,4 years ago,3 stars,The food was okay. The burger was not that warm and the cheese didn't really melt.  They also forgot to give us a burger and some of the sauce. The table locaters were empty so we had to wait at the desk. The tables and seats were clean so that was good.

2368,21,3 weeks ago,5 stars,Not bad ï¿½ï
2369,21,4 years ago,1 star,Very good and efficient. The problem is that the third floor is always close at the hours of 7 pm till all night. And it's difficult to find a seat. I don't understand why you would build a McDonald's with a floor that you hardly used. Plus some of the security are rude to the costumers other then that service is very good
2370,21,5 years ago,4 stars,Fast service but the ordering machine should be fine-tuned to be more user-friendly. There is one staff who is otherwise on standby to help guests with the machines. Dining area is clean and nicely decorated. Great views by the glass windows at the upper floors. Free Wi-Fi is pretty reliable.
2371,21,4 years ago,4 stars,"Fast service, food is good, and modern looking automated ordering kiosks on the wall. 3 floors to sit down and eat and I was surprised how decently clean it was when my friends and I visited here. Not sure if it is this clean on a daily basis, however"
2372,21,3 years ago,3 stars,I don't do McDonald's a lot but this place was okay. They need to stay on the cleanliness and the dining room. Also check the calibration of the sodas constantly because the Sprite tasted like seltzer. They fixed it while I was there though.
2373,21,9 years ago,3 stars,"Not everything is offered at this location since I believe it's an ""express"" of sorts. Straight away, you will notice how crowded this place is since it's a pretty narrow space. Once orders are put in, you never really know where to stand to wait for your food. The staff are nice enough though and the time your food takes to come out can vary widely. There is additional seating upstairs which I personally have not been to and this seems more like a hot spot to just order takeout anyway."
2374,21,a year ago,5 stars,I did my order through the phone probably waited like 5 or 10 minutes mostly my fault for making the order as I was walking in so I understand the wait. Everything was there which I greatly appreciate.

We were there at 9pm today in case any manager wants to speak with the girl I had to deal with (she is wearing glasses and was the one delivering the orders). We ordered 2 menus, 2 shakes and a sundae. The waiting wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t long at all.

2385,21,2 years ago,3 stars,"I love me some McDonald's, but I was saddened with how cold my food was... & you know you can't just throw fastfood frenchfries in the microwave or oven. THEY WERE BUSY TOO- so you would think everything was coming out hot. Sadly, that was not the case. My double-quarterpounder, fries & 4 piece chicken nuggets were all BARELY luke warm."

2387,21,4 years ago,3 stars,"Customer service was pretty good, fast professional & efficient!! As for the breakfast order I made.. it left MUCH to be desired. It was a value meal with bagel, egg, cheese, coffee & hash brown. The bagel with egg would've been fine alone.. What ruined it for me was the 2 layers on the sandwich of what was supposed to be the  ""cheese"".. it was vile!! The ""cheese"" tasted like Cheez Wiz which I TOTALLY despise. To salvage as much of the sandwich as I could.. I scraped off the ""cheese""."
2388,21,5 years ago,5 stars,"Got here in the wee hours and found this place very  clean, quiet and the staff was courteous. I ordered breakfast and asked for it to be fresh and hot. Glad it was made to order, palatable, and hot.  I loved being there on W 34th St, Manhattan."

2390,21,4 years ago,5 stars,"Say what you want about McDonald's, but this location has it figured out! I really hate that I forgot to take pictures for you guys, but go here! They have order kiosks and you can have your food brought to you by one of the staff.
Something that doesn't happen often with McDonald's, but this location really was clean. There was a modern aesthetic to it, along with the pastries (never seen at anothr McDonald's).
The food did take a while but considering the wait volume (-20/30) people, I can understand.
Overall, this is a great place for cheap food to go and to stay. If you're not specific about the way you like your food, order at the kiosk (get a table marker) and go on upstairs and find yourself a table."
2391,21,3 years ago,3 stars,The early morning staff is very courteous.  My big complaint is the non payors that come in and decide the downstairs seating area should be their sleeping space and a place where they should put all their belongings on.
2392,21,a year ago,1 star,"Took forever to get a simple cup of coffee. They seemed totally unprepared for the amount of customers, all while in a prime location that must always have a lot of customers. 7th ave & 34th St, NYC."

2394,21,4 years ago,1 star,"NEVER GO HERE - HORRIBLE SERVICE. They're always rude!!! Either they're RACIST or just plain rude. I asked for a paper bag 3 times and the two Spanish ladies ignored me despite making eye contact. The one at the pick up counter gave a little nod then walked away even though the paper bags were right next to her!! Then I went to the cashier and she just gave me a blank look and motioned to the pick-up counter without saying a word. Then I told the girl yet again, that I need a paper bag please and she just gave me a dumbfounded look with a twang of annoyance and walked away and then fave out more orders. They were just so rude and every other time I've been there! They were all Spanish and maybe don't like Asians but they're horrible people and I never want to go to this location ever again!!!"
2395,21,3 years ago,1 star,"The staff decided that there were no longer any mcflurries, after they prepared 2 sundaes and a milk shake . Suddenly the icecream machine was broken. A Spanish speaking customer after me was then able to order not only a milkshake but3 mcflurries. When I inquired about it I was told that it was now fixed although no one has gone near the machine during the time since I was denied IN ENGLISH. I then stepped outside to get my friends and tell them our food was ready, they took the tray and headed up while I put our other friend in an Uber. When I came back in security who had just been no more then 5 feet from me while I ordered, paid, and received my food, made someone come down to confirm that I was a paying customer. If only the counter staff was as particular as the security guard.
I won't be coming back here again, at least until my Spanish is better"

2399,21,4 years ago,5 stars,"Shamrock shakes are the best! Why can't they serve them all year?! The vanilla soft serve cones are great too, and a really good price. The yummiest thing is to dip your French fries in your shake. I've been coming to McDonalds since I was a kid, and it's still as good... and I'm still as excited to go there as always. Thank you for staying the same."
2400,21,3 years ago,5 stars,I like that there were 3 levels to this McDonald's.  They also have a security guard that you have to show your receipt to to get upstairs.  That should keep alot of people out that are just hanging out using seats and not eating. The food was typical of most McDonald's.

I ordered the cheese sauce and they did not have it in stock. Therefore I asked why they did not have it and that I paid 40 cents for it. Then they said to each other ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
2402,21,3 years ago,2 stars,"They disabled the order kiosks by taking away all the number tents and requiring them. Then i get in a line, which is designed to handle the overflow, not the whole store... 2 cashiers and 25 people. Nice long wait. Then, they didn't give my mcflurry a mix at all. If i wanted a cup of vanilla ice cream with oreo topping, i wouldn't have ordered a mcflurry."
2403,21,a year ago,2 stars,"The food was cold, I couldn't sit in the restaurant to eat it and the service was slow. Not to mention overpriced for what they gave me."
2404,21,4 years ago,3 stars,Went there two days in a row. First day tried using the mcdonald's deals. There wasn't a scanner so worker had to type it in. Said that the deal was only for a free small soft drink and not a small orange juice.  It states what's free in the app. Went back today and used a kiosk. Scanner deal from my phone and the thing froze. This place seems not to except deals at all shame.

2410,21,a year ago,1 star,"The big chicken sandwiches it's not what you see in the commercial on TV not crunchy at all ! chopped up lettuce wilted and small thin slice of tomatoe not fresh,not enjoyable at all!"

2412,21,6 years ago,4 stars,"Great coffee in the morning for only a buck any size anyway. Love it, the best coffee! Food is scrumptious especially anything on the menu but for me the breakfast is my favorite!"
2413,21,3 years ago,2 stars,A very busy McDonald's! Whay under staffed! One young man seemed to be doing all the work involving the food. While they left a inexperienced young lad on the register. She told me my daughter could not have a Dr. Pepper cause it was not a drink choice for the cheeseburger meal. This sounded absurd so when I asked her to explain this she told me no we are just out of it. She was supper sweet and at this point I came to realize only her and the other young man were the only 2 working. As the manager sat there holding a mop and did literally nothing for 20 min. So many McDonald's in NYC and this one was in all Honesty just AWFUL!!
2414,21,3 years ago,5 stars,"As far as a McDonald's goes, it gets 5 stars for being clean and having quick service as well as surprisingly adequate seating. I have not given this location a rating based upon my opinion of McDonald's in general."
2415,21,10 months ago,1 star,Slow service the self order kisoks were broken and the restaurant was filthy.
2416,21,4 years ago,4 stars,"I went on last Wednesday and the automatic machines didn't work for ordering inside. The place was full, too tight for people that were there eating. Apart from this good and quick service."
2417,21,3 years ago,1 star,"Terrible service.

I came into the store and bought my dinner at 9pm.  I sit there for 1 hour and then the staff came to me and asked me to leave. I thought that the store might be closing so I left. However, after I came out, I noticed that this is a 24 hour store. I bought food and no one else was waiting for a table. There was no reason for letting me out. The staff was rude!!!"

2421,21,3 years ago,3 stars,"The meal was as good as Mc Donald's can prepare. The store though , being located across the street from Penn Station one would expect a store size suitable for travelers with bags. This was not the case and the wifi was non existent."
2422,21,3 years ago,1 star,The slowest place I have ever been to. People where not nice at all and after we waited an hour they still didn't give us all we ordered. Pick a different place!
2423,21,4 years ago,2 stars,Its pretty much yhe same as most mcdonalds in the city..least this one is kept clean .only unpleasant sights are all the homeless dirtbags and all the drug addicts that hang around in front and beg for money indide just walk right up to people while their eating  ask for money beg for your food..other then that pretty good for a coty McDonalds....
2424,21,4 years ago,5 stars,"I don't know if I'm like from the 20th century, but this McDonald's is super high-tech. This McDonald consists of three floors. The main floor is what you walk on to, it's the second floor. Most of the seating is on the third floor, I didn't go up to it just because I had an ankle problem and unfortunately the elevator was out. The basement, and area you can't get to it, is where the girl is it so fancy contrapment takes your food from the grill to the second floor where you order. I just thought that was cool while I was waiting around for my food. They have about six self-serving machines that are in front of the restaurant. But if you want to speak to a human you can just walk past that to the two registers they have"

2431,21,a year ago,3 stars,"Waited too long for a regular order, if I didn't check, smoothies not in the bag, store is unorganized!"

2433,21,5 years ago,2 stars,On McDonalds I've ever been to that has a security guard. Does not let you pee before you order. Other than that the place is clean and fine.

2435,21,6 years ago,4 stars,"McDonald's food is usually the same everywhere I go. Yay fastfood. I went to this one during the Big Apple Comic Con 2017 weekend. They handled the con rush well. Costumes and hungry cos players can be a struggle, but the managers were right there with their employees making sure everything was ok. A homeless dude was asking for money. Kind of sucked, but they got rid of him quickly though."

2909,21,a week ago,2 stars,Very expensive and super bad service. The place was clean.
2910,21,2 months ago,4 stars,"I always visit this place whenever I have to wait for the train
Very good customer service.
I like McDonald's...
a very safe place"
2911,21,7 months ago,1 star,"Very poor McDonald's in terms of service and friendliness. Could only get food in a bag. Long wait and no overview in the numbers of the orders. We were 5 people and a large part of the order was missing. Fortunately, that was quickly arranged after having to wait again. Apparently upstairs where you can sit closed at 8 pm. Fifteen minutes before, a lady came to report that they were closing. She kept holding the door open until everyone had actually left. After 5 minutes we also left and the rest were able to eat in the rain. Something is seriously wrong there."
2912,21,a week ago,5 stars,Very quiet place and good attention
2913,21,6 months ago,2 stars,"The food was good, the speed of the order to withdraw online was fine, but it was 8:25 a McDonald's worker came in and told us in a very bad way that we had 5 minutes to finish eating and we had just started eating."
2914,21,9 months ago,5 stars,"Mc Do with order at the terminals, a lot of space on 2 floors and very located."
2915,21,9 months ago,1 star,"The worst experience I've ever had in my life!! With saying that I could not taste the food! A restaurant where the staff yells at you is not worthy of being visited by ANYONE!! Sure, I must be specific! It was in this specific place, but they should take action!!"
2916,21,3 months ago,4 stars,"The best thing about it is its location but the quality of its food, its appearance and taste and service I give it a 3."
2917,21,6 years ago,4 stars,"This is a rather well decorated and pleasant McDonald's! In addition to being fabulously located in the middle of the gigantic skyscrapers of Broadway, this place is not excessively crowded, which makes it even more pleasant! And finally (a fundamental and important detail these days) there is Wifi! So I recommend this place! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"
2918,21,9 months ago,3 stars,"The hall is closed, there is nowhere to sit. Although most places have already canceled these restrictions.

I had to wait a super long time for the order, and, as always, I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
2919,21,11 months ago,5 stars,The quality is good and the prices are reasonable too. Even cheap by New York standards. Store was clean. Simply order via terminal.
2920,21,11 months ago,3 stars,"In general, all McDonald's are the same, these ones here in NY have been very crowded lately and there is usually no space to sit at peak hours. But they are still the best option to eat for the prices of the combos."
2921,21,4 years ago,3 stars,Option for a quick snack for those who don't miss the opportunity to breathe the air of Times Square at dawn. This branch is just a few minutes' walk away.
2922,21,7 months ago,3 stars,"Long waiting time, tastier food and a larger selection than at McDonald's in the Czech Republic.
Super atmosphere. Thanks"
2923,21,9 months ago,5 stars,"Excellent attention, in May of this year two employees treated my husband and I very badly, they even spoke to us badly, they even scratched our food and we argued, but they are not all the same, there are very good workers..."
2924,21,a week ago,4 stars,A little dirty
2925,21,11 months ago,3 stars,"We ordered a hamburger and fries. The plain vanilla ice cream for about $2. The food was average and below.
The place itself is clean, cozy, there are 2 upper floors for sitting."
2926,21,7 months ago,1 star,"Flee, at 10 p.m. 5 seats to eat inside. We have to take out!"
2927,21,a year ago,3 stars,"Food was not really tasty, few seats. We received food in a bag, regardless of whether we came to collect or not."
2928,21,a year ago,5 stars,"Good food, it did not have many people and there was not a long line of people, they attended us quickly, the only thing is that the bathrooms open until 8 in the morning and we arrived very early, hee"
2929,21,a year ago,4 stars,"A traditional MC Do, it's fast and it's good. You can take a break and enjoy the Wi-Fi."
2930,21,4 years ago,5 stars,Very good system to order without having to queue! Once you understand how the app works it's great for those with language difficulties! You have the option to make the hamburger to your liking! I hope I apply it soon in Argentina!
2931,21,4 years ago,5 stars,"The system of screens to order without having to speak to an employee is incredible because you save the long lines that are made and it comes in the language you want, (although it is only paid by card), everything is very cheap and clean, but they let you enter many homeless people who are a bit rude and occupy all the seats and sometimes you cannot sit down to eat because there is no place."
2932,21,a year ago,3 stars,"It is not working 100% but because it is fast food, it is convenient to buy and continue on the road without wasting much time. Sometimes the attention is not as friendly as it should be, and at night after 11:00 p.m. there is no ice to prepare certain drinks, it is something to improve"
2933,21,3 years ago,5 stars,Pure beauty! Fast service. Agile as in most stores. Immaculate bathroom. And in this one there were two bathrooms. Different from the Mac I posted earlier. Note: The attendant speaks at least 3 languages. I liked!!!
2934,21,a year ago,4 stars,We were only here for drinks. $1 for a large drink was a welcome price in expensive New York!
2935,21,a year ago,5 stars,"I ate in a very clean place and the ladies who serve are very friendly, even the security is very nice. He gave me the order, thanks, everything was fine."
2936,21,3 months ago,4 stars,A little cleaning in the client room
2937,21,5 years ago,1 star,I was very bad there at 4:45 and the attention of a lady raises a lot to be desired I came from a long trip I arrived at the station but she was in a bad temper I asked her for something and reluctantly she told me that they did not have more than breakfast I could not hear in short bad service
2938,21,5 years ago,4 stars,"Exactly the same as all MacDonald's. They had a cheap menu of 1, 2 and 3 dol. I didn't like them because they gave me heartburn the 2 times I ate."
2939,21,a year ago,2 stars,"The truth is that in the USA in Queens they don't even let you sit in a drive tru, it's very ugly."
2940,21,5 years ago,2 stars,"You get your food stowed in a bag as standard whether you want to eat in or take it with you. Sauce on the Mc fish fillet also oilier than normal. Furthermore, this Mc on 34th street was dingy."
2941,21,5 months ago,5 stars,Good attention ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
2942,21,4 years ago,4 stars,"For self-help travel, choosing fast food is the most convenient way to solve meals. When you are in a foreign country, you think it is unpalatable, but it is actually quite delicious."
2943,21,4 years ago,5 stars,"Super the new system of ordering and paying yourself and being taken to the table just by the number
The waiter is super attentive and you can ask them for the sauces you want"
2944,21,4 years ago,3 stars,"It has improved a lot but they are always missing something... wait what too, shop at the end of the world!"
2945,21,a year ago,5 stars,Good place in Philly!
2946,21,a year ago,4 stars,Definitely better than what we are used to in Italy
2947,21,3 years ago,3 stars,I went there after New Year's Eve countdown in New York. Americans eat hamburgers after parties like Japanese people eat ramen. I know that feeling. Thank you for being open despite the late night of the end of the year!
2948,21,3 years ago,3 stars,Normal Mac Donald's. We tried table service but they got our order wrong. Nothing special
2949,21,4 years ago,5 stars,A good and cheap alternative to eat something in Manhattan

2967,21,4 years ago,1 star,The burger was ok but the coke had no gas...ï¿½ï
2968,21,6 years ago,4 stars,It is mc but the space is very small. In that city at rush hour you can't find where to sit.

The self-ordering machines don't print receipts with your number so you better catch it on the screen because they may or may not see it on the system.  Fortunately, I was only getting some sodas and they didn't question my order but if it had been a real order it might not have gone smoothly."
3160,35,11 months ago,1 star,Worst service I had experience in years. Bathroom was closed before 8pm and they did not empathize with me desperately needing to go pee so I had to go to a nearby pizza place to use the restroom. I ordered 2 medium Frappe and they gave me small. I would not recommend anyone because they do not seem to care about providing basic needs to its customers.
3161,35,3 months ago,5 stars,I placed a mobile order and within 5 minutes of entering the restaurant my order was ready. The food was really fresh and they gave me all the condiments I asked for. Great service!
3162,35,4 months ago,4 stars,Probably the cleanest McDonald in the city.  It's partly due to the posted security at the front door to prevent transient homelessness to take over.  Also the competent day and night managers who motivated the food preparation team to perform optimally.  This place should be the exemplary MacDonald store that all the other macDonald stores in the city should learn from.
3163,35,6 days ago,1 star,Very dirty. Served cold drinks warm and without ice and very unorganized.
3164,35,5 months ago,2 stars,"A friendly and responsive staff delivered (twice after I brought it back) coffee that was not hot. After the second time, I just gave my cup to my daughter whose iced coffee was way too light with cream and diluted. Surprised that McDonalds quality control failed on this visit."

3167,35,4 years ago,3 stars,"It's a hit or miss with McDonald's location. At times you can recieved a good customer service and wait a long while to get your food. When you finally get your food from waiting so long (this is when it's not busy), the food is not assembled properly or it's over cooked almost border line burnt. If you wanted coffee from this location, major of the staff cant make good coffee. I often look for a particular employee that makes it the best. On the other hand, this location is one of the most cleanest locations I've ever been in. Management does a good job making sure everything is clean and ready for business. Every time I come in their always cleaning the deep fryer, counters, refilling the machines and all, despite all the college kids and tourists wreaking the joint. They do pick up the place in high traffic and complete orders in a timely manner with sacrifice to customer experience. I would love to see more pride in the making of the order look close to the photo and consistency with delivering good customer service."

Last night (22/10), whoever worked there needs to be let go. We and other customers were yelled at - the virtual cash register was not working with the receipt, so my boyfriend went to the front register to pay and the worker yanked the card out of my bfs hand, sighed like super annoying. When he turned around to wait,  we heard him saying out loud 'customers are so stupid, not listening"" :/
Myself and some other customers got yelled at for sitting down. I also needed go to the bathroom but didn't know it was shut but got yelled at. Not sure what was going on with rather staff but rude did not cut it."

3230,35,3 years ago,4 stars,"They had a very limited space, but to make an agile experience, they have two big touch screen menus to place your order faster than going to directly to the cashier line. They only have one unisex restroom, so if you are in a hurry, be prepared mentally to wait. Anyway I think you'll enjoy your meal, if you take in consideration these things."

3233,35,4 years ago,1 star,"Not terribly clean. Stopped in and decided to buy snacks here as we also needed a restroom. Sign was placed on the restroom marking it closed just after we received our order. Coffee drink my husband ordered was certainly not coffee, perhaps a milky product and lots of ice?"
3234,35,5 years ago,2 stars,"This location tends to vary in quality.  If it's raining, I would recommend you not go since they close the upstairs and the seating becomes scarce due to the campers taking up the front of the store. When it's nice out it isn't much better though since the place is very dark and feels damp. I how's think they are trying to help people not eat their food since it is a very unappetizing place to eat."
3235,35,4 years ago,5 stars,"The golden arches they way they should be.  Fast, easily customizable ordering (at kiosk).  Food prepared quickly (and to spec) without issue. Nice indoor space - helpful and friendly staff.  This location sets the bar pretty high."

I didn't even eat my fires . its Covid time be careful."

When I went to pick up my food I asked if they can show me which toys they had today because i wanted to collect all of they toys for my daughter. They looked at me like i had 3 heads and said, we dont have toys. I replied, no toys in a McDonald's? Thats a shame. They tell me they only have the old ones. So i ask another worker who was extremely rude, and ignored me the whole time. She then says give me 1 minute while having her back turned so I didnt hear it especially with these masks on. I wait a little and see her making little effort to help me as if i was asking for something not worth their time. So I ask another employee and she points at the other employee saying ask her. All I wanted was a toy for my daughter. Those employees need to get out of there if they dont want to work there."
3238,35,5 years ago,3 stars,Frequently drama filled. Staff can be disorganized and arguing amongst themselves in front of customers. Homeless and users are common. General stop for tourists to use the bathroom. Access to reasonably priced items relatively quickly makes it worthwhile for a quick visit.

Probably will place my food orders elsewhere"

They were talking about jumping a girl. And when I went to order I took a second to take my phone out to show her the deal I wanted and she snapped at me and said HELLO and repeated my order and said OKAY?! I said yeah but I have a deal I want to use. She waved it off and said ""it don't work"". She was snapping her fingers and voice. I literally just got there and she was just already angry standing there. I took my card out to use and she said ""You have cash? That don't work!"" As if I knew. She didn't state it beforehand. What I didn't understand was everyone else before me ordered with a card? So I just told her I don't have cash and walked off the line. I saw people using their cards and when I saw that I got upset. I just got done working a long day and I was tired and hungry and just wanted my McChicken and fries. I got back on line and there was her friend. The friend told me to insert my card. I asked her if it works she said yeah. I said so WHY did the other lady tell me otherwise? Then the lady saw me on line again she said ""I just told her the app don't work why is she asking again?!"" I said ""Actually, you also said the card reader doesn't work and it does so I wouldn't know what's true or not?"" She said ""WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO?!"" ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE. They both started laughing. There was a pretty big spider walking around on the floor too. All the tables were dirty. And the guy cleaning was on his phone and rapping. And looking at other customers butts. She handed me the food harshly. They're all children. Immature children. Absolutely disrespectful."

They didn't have Sprite, or Hi-C orange.  Some guy in a black tank top got up from the table and walked to the back where they were preparing food. Now I realized it was an employee, not in uniform.  Bathroom was out of order and every table that I went to was dirty.  It's been a while since I've eaten in there, it looks like new management??  I'm concerned."
3257,35,3 years ago,3 stars,"The food is predictably reliable, as it is part of the McDonald's NY franchise.  Automated ordering and paying with a pick up counter puts this one up-to-date.  But the clientele here may be a little... wilder than some other locations, and at this one, the single bathroom was unsanitary and had no working lock!  Ugh..."
3258,35,5 years ago,1 star,"Terrible place filled with druggies and bums, thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s even a security guard who has to be standing there making sure everyoneï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s safe or kicking people out.

3259,35,4 years ago,4 stars,"Absolutely functional! You can order fast and sure, when I went I was sure that It would take lot of time but that didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t happen, the food was cooked in just a few minutes, and it"
3260,35,a month ago,4 stars,Pretty cool one.
3261,35,5 years ago,1 star,"Customer service is very poor. For the frosty, they added the toppings on top of regular soft serve and didn't even bother mixing in. And when I asked for ketchup for the fries, they handed me the ketchup box for me to grab some ketchup packets."
3262,35,4 years ago,1 star,"Good luck getting service. I tried to order at the counter instead of the kiosk, and stood there as 3 people directly on the other side of the counter ignored me for ages. I could understand if it was busy, but I was the only person there! I finally gave up and went to Shake Shack."
3263,35,3 years ago,5 stars,They're rather consistent at this McDonald's. The food obviously taste the same everywhere so I don't feel I need to speak on that aspect. The workers listen and it's a quick eat everytime I go on my break so I can't complain
3264,35,a year ago,4 stars,You can sit and eat inside. The quality of the food is always on point during Breakfast and lunch hours. I have yet to visit during dinner hours.
3265,35,10 months ago,1 star,The worst one in the city. Finger indentations in my squashed triple cheeseburger gross! Cold and disgusting tasting too.
3266,35,6 years ago,5 stars,"Food was good , I honestly didn't really pay attention to it. I just needed to order food so I could use their bathroom to roll a blunt. The stall was big enough to spread out and break that loud up. So I twisted and bounced but the realized I left my Swisher Pack in the stall. I returned and as I was walking in a guy was coming out. He had my wrap pack in his hand to throw away when we connected eyes. So we talked for a second and decided to match. My boy met up too and we burned down. Dude musta threw some PCP on his because I was tripping balls soon after. I woke up the next day naked in a field with the cops asking questions. I dunno man. 5/7 would do again though"
3267,35,4 years ago,4 stars,"Very quick service, surprisingly easy to operate their self service kiosk. Order was ready really fast. I usually don't go to McDonalds but I was in a tight time crunch. For a McDonald's restaurant it was not very busy. I would definitely go back to this location if I needed to go to McDonalds in New York City. Highly recommend stopping in to this location if you are in the area."
3268,35,2 years ago,1 star,"The 1st issue with this McDonald's location was at 7pm they don't have sweet tea.  Secondly, the water for a hot tea was luke warm, at best, then when asked, ""Is this the hottest this water can get?""  With a response of yes.  This is at 7pm.  McDonald's food quality has dipped since this pandemic and I suppose it's because if it.  Boooo."
3269,35,a month ago,1 star,Staff Super Ghetto
3270,35,5 years ago,1 star,"Lousy dirty dangerous place. Full of junkies, crackheads and homeless people. This place should have an armed security guard to keep it safe and clean.  Do not bring children here. Do not step foot in here. Worst I have ever seen.

There is one bathroom that locks and itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s filthy"
3271,35,6 years ago,4 stars,"This is a 24/7 location, which is great. The receipt printer was broken for a while which was annoying because they would still read off the order numbers as a method of calling people. Also, the layout is a bit odd. It narrows significantly in the middle of the store, making it hard to get through to the doors and the counter at busier times."
3272,35,7 months ago,3 stars,I had the fries and coffee. They were good.
3273,35,5 years ago,1 star,"I ordered an M&M McFlurry and paid. Then they handed me an Oreo McFlurry and said they were out of M&Ms. That is not what I ordered so it was very disappointing and annoying, but since I'd already paid there was nothing I could do but keep the Oreo. Then when I asked for my receipt because I didn't want them to leave my credit card info on the counter they started explaining that they're out of M&Ms--a concept I understood even though I was annoyed about it.
Also, the bathroom is gross and the top floor is never open."
3274,35,4 years ago,1 star,"Every franchise I have been to in NYC has been very disappointing. Most team members, not all, loathe their job. Furthermore I can never reliably tell if McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s is 24hrs anymore because of the inevitable ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"
3275,35,3 years ago,1 star,The night supervisor in grey is very rude. Although it says 24/7 they often close around 1 am.  Unless you order uber eats u are not able to come in and place your order.
3276,35,5 months ago,4 stars,Best for quick breakfast.
3277,35,4 years ago,2 stars,They moved fast but it wasnt very crowded. The food wasnt that good it was no salt on the fries and my burger was extrs salty. Then they gave me orange soda because they didnt have strawberry fanta but thats def not what i wanted. If im ever in the area i wont be coming back here.
3278,35,5 years ago,3 stars,It's fine. I love the seat setup. I just don't understand why the upstairs is always closed. This is one of those places that usually has ice cream
3279,35,5 years ago,5 stars,"VERY Busy If Your Looking For ""FAST Food"" This ISN'T The Place, Depending On WHAT Time You Come, You WILL Be Waiting For YOUR Food For UP TO 15-20 Minutes....And MOST Of The Cashier's Attitudes Are WORSE Then The Wait LOL....Oh And Your Probably GOING TO Be Approached At LEAST Twice By A Junkie Or Homeless Person WHILE Your Eating....BUT Enjoy The Foods OKAY...."
3280,35,4 years ago,5 stars,"Busy as heck, but it does what McDonalds normally do - gets you standardized food quickly without any fuss.  One-person bathroom for customers only, but two levels of seating.  Honestly, we want here because we were burned out from a day of ""touristing"" and just wanted something to eat quickly."
3281,35,10 months ago,1 star,Really rude cashiers. Bathroom was broken. Awful hot chocolate.
3282,35,a year ago,1 star,DONï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½T order through uber eats they forget to give you the sauces
3283,35,4 years ago,4 stars,"Great service, and extremely quickly served.
Very friendly, kind and professional staff.
Will most certainly visit again.
And yes, the food in McDonald's is always satisfying. An American Classic.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"
3284,35,6 years ago,4 stars,"It's not a bad McDonald's by any stretch of the imagination, but there are better in Manhattan.  It's fairly clean, there's plenty of seating, the food was made well.  There are none of those fancy new ordering kiosks, and the bathrooms are dirty."
3285,35,5 years ago,2 stars,The cashiers seem to have no idea what is going on. Mess up orders. Literally give small portions. Ordered a sandwich and they gave me one of smallest chicken that i've seen. I wouldn't recommend this place. Find a better McDonalds around.
3286,35,a year ago,1 star,"12:43 am on a Sunday. They were closed. 24 hours is not accurate, please update the hours. -signed, heartbroken and hungry"
3287,35,a year ago,5 stars,Very clean nice friendly staff & the coffee is delicious. I enjoy the 2 for $6 fish sandwiches.
3288,35,4 years ago,1 star,I dont like MacDonalds in NY.  Has a horrible attendance and this thing of asking to open the bathroom to be able to use is not pleasant. On one occasion my niece went to make the request for all and the security said that if we were not going to buy nothing was to vacate the table.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
3289,35,a year ago,5 stars,"The place is not crowded, because the staff work really fast. They are so nice and friendly. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"
3290,35,6 years ago,1 star,This is the worst McDonald's in New York City. The heroin users congregate at the main table in front of the register and they harass customers as they come in. They nod off and just buy a soda or water to occupy the table for hours. There's homeless in front of the McDonald's and to the side and inside there's a lot of shady individuals that are just sitting there coming down off heroin highs. The service is mediocre and the atmosphere is gross. For it to be across the street from NYU this should be a whole nother level of security and quality.
3291,35,7 years ago,1 star,"Absolutely horrid customer service; and even though I have lower expectations for a McDonald's in food quality, this has particularly bare food taste and is often served sloppily. Eye contact is optional in their employee training, apparently."
3292,35,5 years ago,1 star,"They have a security guard who has the key of the restroom and he thinks he owns it he got upset because I was holding the door for my friend to use it cuz he was waiting too as I did ,the security guard doesn't come until 7 am so if you buy something before that you are not able to use the restroom until he comes ,the bathroom doesn't look from inside means that anybody can open the restroom while you still using it, he also was arresting us cuz my friend took a little bit longer in the restroom and he ask me if my friend smokes I think that unprofessional!"
3293,35,6 years ago,3 stars,My food was delicious but they did mess up my order. The bathroom was so nasty and there is nowhere to put your stuff while you hover over the piss covered seat.
3294,35,3 years ago,5 stars,"Very convenient location where you have NYU School, NYU Bookstore, subways and buses, Footlocker, Buffalo Exchange store, Washington Square Park, Joe's Pub, Donut shop (I highly recommend), etc. Lots of students around....always a busy area however; McDonald's is kept clean, on time with food, but go at a time when it's less busy."
3295,35,2 years ago,5 stars,"Got my order quickly, unfortunately had to eat outside. Just spoils the experience. Can't wait til this covid thing blows over."
3296,35,4 years ago,3 stars,The usual steady consistency in their coffee and brew fresh when asked. Its not the best but brew fresh and stronger than DD any day
3297,35,6 years ago,2 stars,"Food was the bog standard, biggest issues here are:
1. The cheeseburger I ordered had a hard bun.
2. Service was terribe there should be lines or devides to clearly mark queing lanes rather than someone shouting ""There are three lines"" and there be nobody serving in the other 2.
3. They messed up my order (seems to be the case in every McDonald's in NYC they seem to miss out 2 of the things on my order, that being fries or drink.)
Wouldn't recomend."
3298,35,4 years ago,1 star,"took ten minutes to convince the staff to let me use the bathroom even after purchasing a full meal, because ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½someone was in thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"

3305,35,2 years ago,4 stars,"Not bad manager is rude to customers n employees, food was good kid at register was very nice"
3306,35,3 years ago,1 star,Why did I ever think think that McDonald's had anything good for cheap. The best thing is their overpriced fries. The burger mouth feel was like tofu. I hope millennials kill ol' McDonald with their healthy spending habits.
3307,35,3 years ago,5 stars,It was really busy and the late night staff was out numbered but they pulled through and did a very great job. I am very proud of them and also my sammie was yummy
3308,35,4 years ago,1 star,"Typical McDonald's experience. Long lines. Long wait (considering what you're getting). Rude, ghetto employees. Equally rude and ghetto patrons. Just there for a cheap ""quick"" snack or meal."
3309,35,4 years ago,3 stars,I don't think I will be going to the 1st Ave and 14th street location any time soon.  Too many people just sitting around occupying space without ordering and I saw individuals walk in and  walk up to the sofa machine with their own cup and serve themselves soda and walk out. One guy came in with a bag from KFC containing 2 buckets and 4 boxes with a cup and take soda from the machine and walk out.  Crazy
3310,35,2 years ago,3 stars,This place was okay it wasn't crowded and the food was very fresh is nice quiet place to sit and eat
3311,35,5 years ago,4 stars,"Taylor was absolutely amazing to me...
This was great experience after having bad ones at other locations. Very happy. Will come again."
3312,35,3 years ago,1 star,"It's a place you can't stay for more than 30 mins even though you buy its food. It's better to just close this McDonald, so that the manager will not worry about the time anymore."
3313,35,6 years ago,5 stars,Ive been going to this location for a long time and when the seats began to look worn they were there within a few days to renovate and make it sparkle again.

3321,35,4 years ago,3 stars,It's a McDonald's. Nothing amazing. Wasn't too clean but I gave it 3 stars cuz my vanilla shake was made quickly and tasted better than normal.

Out of stock on alot of items"
3328,35,5 years ago,4 stars,"Its... McDonald's. If you've been to one you've practically been to them all. Service was nice enough around breakfast time, food quality can be hit or miss, do they even care about Google reviews?"
3329,35,6 years ago,3 stars,"Service is okay -- not the fastest but not the slowest. Seating is limited. They have a bizarre sign ""no loitering - 30min max""."

3333,35,5 years ago,3 stars,Traditional run of the mill McDonalds. The food and staff and everything was what I expected of a McDonalds. I'm not personally a huge fan of McDonalds but if you are this place would be great I imagine. Also don't forget to use their app they have so many great coupons and offers on it so you can get free stuff.
3334,35,5 years ago,2 stars,The food was ok but the staff were just rude and have no idea of what customers are. The security guard was a good man tho.

3980,7,2 months ago,3 stars,"Pretty decent McDonalds to get decently priced food in the heart of Lower East Side. The interior is super spacious, there are kiosks built into the walls, and the bathroom was super clean. Unfortunately, they closed the second floor for reasons unknown. It was also super busy when I went (Friday Night) so the orders took an extremely long amount of time to prepare (over 15-20 minutes)."

3983,27,a year ago,4 stars,"Got two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches.  Both were good as expected.  I ordered through the McDonald's app and opted to pickup my sandwiches at the drive thru.  I told the employee at the speaker that I had an app order to pickup and gave her the code.  She instructed me to go to the first window.  There I was given the receipt, thanked, and told to go to the next window.  At the 2nd window I was told to go to a 3rd window to pickup the order.  The 3rd window is kind of funny, since it seems like an afterthought.  Since it is at the corner of the building close to a sign, it is difficult to get close enough to be handed the order without scraping the side of your car. Then to leave you have to turn your wheels hard right.  The employees were very friendly."
3984,27,a month ago,2 stars,"Ordered on the machine because the workers were too busy talking.  Pay by card at the machine and no receipt comes out.  I tell the worker I didn't get a receipt and he says ""don't worry we will bring it out."" I dutifully sit down with my table number with my family and wait. I really wanted my receipt, and, as you can imagine, this will be important later.

So we sit around for a while, I go and ask for ketchup, cream, and sugar.  Get like 4 ketchup packs for 4 people's orders.  Ketchup poor I make my way back to my disappointed family and dole out one ketchup each.

More waiting, finally I go up with my table number and ask about the order.  The same worker looks at me and says ""do you have a receipt?"" My pocket-version of Kafka bursts into flames and I can only laugh at the absurdity.  I finally get the attention of the manager who manages to pull my order from the void of the machine.

Why two stars? Because when the g
Food came the bread was good, it tasted ""fresher"" than other recent McDonalds forays and  from the time they pulled the order to when we got the food was pretty quick."

I realize it's a busy place but some attention to detail is needed."
4007,27,a year ago,4 stars,Glad I walked in. The drive-thru line was ginormous. (TWO lines!) Ordering inside was pretty easy - a couple order kiosks or a plexi-barrier'ed pair of cash registers. Time spent waiting was a lot less than if waiting in the drive thru lanes(s). Clean tables and floor - actually being mopped while I was there.

4011,27,a year ago,1 star,I would give this zero if I could. I just wanted to order a sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich with scrambled egg instead of classic. Normally there is no issue. Today the person at the drive through decided they could not do that. After asking him if he could check he said he was the manager and no. I asked him for his name and he refused to give it to me. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not even about the egg.

4012,27,a year ago,2 stars,"First of all, I can't understand why they had such a poor design with parking. Parking is hard to get into and the shopping center has such a big parking lot. It's such poor design. Then they take a while for dine-in. It's faster if you order on the kiosk or app instead of waiting for them to take your order."
4013,27,6 months ago,2 stars,Not very convenient if you just want to dine inside there's very little parking and difficult to get to other than that the food is the same.

I couldn't figure out how they could be so crowded without even a place to sit down. Unless they all had a terrible time at the cash register which kept in there after ordering. I've been to this McDonald's before, it's been slow before. But nothing like today. terribly disappointing. My first five minutes I was with an inexperienced cashier. So I can't blame her. Before the manager to take another 15 minutes ridiculous."
4017,27,8 months ago,1 star,This is scandalous I came to this location and it was closing one of the employees went running to put some cones on drive Thru to make it seem they are close. It was 11:00 pm still one more hour until they close .

Fries were perfect. I love the fries!"
4023,27,a year ago,1 star,"I ordered a Sprite and waited for my receipt and watched the girl throw it away as I waited. Ok. I drive through to pick up and am told that Sprite is out.

My issue is that no one knew. Not when I placed my order or when I went to pay. Even the guy at the 2nd window didn't know until he tried to get my drink.

So I ask for my money back. The guy asked me for my receipt. For a dollar in the drive thru. I told him the lady didn't give me one. He takes a few minutes and then asks me to pull forward.

""For a dollar?"" I reply. Bc really this is ridiculous. The last time I pulled forward no one ever came! Plus the guy didn't even confirm what I am waiting for - a manager or my dollar?

I finally got my dollar tho."

And girlfriend, practice makes perfect, put yourself out there!"
4026,27,5 years ago,3 stars,Be careful parking on the south side of the building during busy hours because the cars in the drive thru will block you in. It's very tight.
4027,27,2 years ago,1 star,Can't take an order. I ordered 2 happy meals and they recorded one. At the pay window I corrected their mistake and paid for two. Then at the second window they only gave me one and insisted I only paid for one. They absolutely refused to give me 4 little nuggets and a couple of fries. This is the McDonald's closest to my house and I go there frequently. Well not anymore. I hope the $4.99 they stole from me with make up for the $40 I typically spend there weekly.
4028,27,3 years ago,1 star,"My daughter and I stopped in for a quick bite about 3:30 on Saturday 14th. We were charged for something that should have been free. The young female supervisor or manager that had to take care of the refund was very rude and unapologetic for their mistake. The worst customer service I've had in that square in years.  Perhaps when they did the remodel they should have gotten rid of the terrible staff as well. Come on McDonald's you can do better than that. Please take some pride and have expectations for your employees serving your public. Terrible place, I truly hope they fire that supervisor, trust me she's not worth the money she's being paid."

I literally had to get agressive and ask for a Manager on duty to get some assistance. What really ticked me off was when a guy came in on a wheel chair and we were both patiently waiting for some assistance. Customer service definitely isn't a priority at this location. No ""Hi, welcome, we'll be right with you"". Nothing. When I told the woman there that they had customers, all I got was a ""I know"". Unprofessional, unapologetic, and uncaring staff and I think the woman may have been a supervisor/manager. Her shirt was different from the rest. Would rate this store a 0 if I could."

If you're here hunting happy meal toys, they charge you $2 for the toy, some places will charge only $1. You can use the McDonald's app here, but beware the tricky mobile app order and pay. Mobile is a pain to use, they're not always able to know where your order is, and it takes way longer to order on your phone or at a kiosk than it does in person. Drive-through doesn't get too bad because there's tons of food options nearby."

4061,27,6 months ago,4 stars,Love the pricing and unique item offerings.
4062,27,3 years ago,5 stars,"I happen to love Tommy's, but it definitely is not everyone's cup of tea. Their chili burger is their traditional specialty. It has meat, chili, tomato, onions, and pickle. The chili seems greasy but I love it.

Tommy's is an acquired taste. I've been going to the original tommys since 1968 in Los Angeles at Beverly and rampart. That shack is open twenty-four hours a day, and you basically eat outside, putting your food on a ledge and standing to eat it.

This Tommy's is a more traditional restaurant, where are you give your order inside, pick it up and sit down in comfort.

I love that the fries are large because they hold the heat much longer than small fries.

I used to order extra chili with my hamburger, and it made things very messy. What I learned at this visit was to have the chili put on the side, so I could add it as I wanted.

there are many different types and flavors to chili. This was brought home to me one time when I was at the original Tommy's and picked up my burger and drink right after a couple. They ended up eating nearby, and I heard the mail of the couple exclaim, ""That's not good chili!""

I was wondering what part of the Southwest he was from because of his critique. I just about choked on my drink when I heard him say, ""If you want good chili, you need to come to New York!""

I'm sure that there are good places to get chili in New York, but that guy was probably one of the people that considers everything west of the Hudson River to be a dining desert."
4063,27,4 years ago,3 stars,They messed up my order and I only ordered 3 small burgers. But I called and one of the managers said she will fix it for me. Food was good no line at the time I went

4331,19,3 months ago,5 stars,"On March 13, I was at this cafe and I really liked the staff, they were so polite and caring.

I especially liked the friendly guy, the employee at the entrance, he met everyone at the entrance, greeted and opened the door. This guy was so sweet and caring, I just saw such great employees in this fast food chain. He is simply worthy of the award as the most customer-oriented employee. I also really liked the kitchen, everything is cooked very quickly here and what is rare in these restaurants, they make excellent coffee here."
4332,19,a month ago,5 stars,"This is my go to McDonald's spot at 262 Canal St. There are seats available to sit downstairs and upstairs. I like the atmosphere and spaciousness. The staff working here are friendly and polite. Today only you can get a free Mc chicken, no purchase necessary. I redeemed my free Mc Chicken, it was fresh and warm when I got mine."
4333,19,3 days ago,2 stars,"Staff is extremely rude and unprofessional. Except for the young 19 year old woman at the register that got the toy I specifically asked for. She was very kind. The other two, a young man and a lady that seemed like the manager had a nasty attitude and the manager spoke to the helpful cashier very rudely"
4334,19,3 months ago,5 stars,This is a such a different design of McDonald's. I love it!
4335,19,3 weeks ago,1 star,"Rude staff. Happened a few nights ago. While dining upstairs with my family and a few more guests in another table, the spanish speaking lady staff told us (arrogantly) to leave as they were already closing. She could have informed us in a nicer way. But when we went down, new customers were still coming in."

She yells, makes rude gestures, and was acting extremely bothered to even work there. She disrespected many of her customers including me and my partner twice. Was intolerable to eat there, so we took our food elsewhere. Restroom is only "
4337,19,4 years ago,4 stars,Very nice and friendly staff I felt welcome. They are very clean and attentive. They have table service. They have the machines that you can order by yourself. They have soda dispenser so free refills. They have 3 floors. They have bathrooms for men and women. The bathroom was nasty and dirty.

4342,19,5 months ago,1 star,This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. They made me show a receipt to just use their disgusting bathroom. They could at least clean it once a month. Also everyone was rude as could be. The customers are paying your bills. Don't go here.
4343,19,5 years ago,4 stars,"After exploring Chinatown in lower Manhattan, I decided to walk to the only McDonald's in the immediate area, on the south side of Canal Street. It didn't look like much from the outside, but once I entered I walked up to the counter to order one coffee which took a few minutes since the place was somewhat busy and there was a customer in line in front of me.

I got my order and walked upstairs to the first level and sat at a comfortable booth. Within a few minutes a manager came to my table to ask if everything was OK, and I told him ""Yes"", but I was having trouble to connect to the free WiFi. He immediately helped me with this and although the connection was slow, I was pleased that the problem was solved.

Then the manager chatted with me and asked if I would mind doing a survey and I filled out the online survey. Then he said I was entitled to a free burger so I had a Big Mac.

I think this is a very well managed place and will definitely return when I am back in Manhattan in the Chinatown area."
4344,19,a month ago,5 stars,The location was great - but the side lobby was packed with kids smoking weed.

Asked nicely to put ketchup packets in my bag, she threw them on the counter, and proceeded to speak spanish to another employee.

4354,19,3 weeks ago,5 stars,"Just the best McDonald's in Manhattan in my opinion, free refills, A third floor!???! Would come again."
4355,19,5 months ago,4 stars,It's a McDonald's. The kiosks were working and the service was quick. I didn't go upstairs to check out the dining room.
4356,19,6 years ago,4 stars,"The food was came out little late, but the clerk gave apple pie for service. I was really satisfied. The icecream cone is little expensive than any other country."

4358,19,2 months ago,4 stars,A really good place to eat. The place is very clean.
4359,19,2 months ago,5 stars,It was Mc Donalds!. I was hoping that this  Mc Donald packaging would have  Chinese wrapping  since this Mc Donalds is located in Chinatown.

4362,19,10 months ago,3 stars,"It's a small McDonald's comparing to other. Very few seating and small seating area. Service and menu is same like other McDonald's, may slight high price. Location is precious, customer moderate at the morning. Customer service good."
4363,19,7 months ago,5 stars,It's McDonald's it's fast and staff is as friendly as it gets. Just don't be rude and they won't be rude. The staff gives attitude to people who give them attitude first.
4364,19,11 months ago,2 stars,"I was told that I had to buy something in order for my young child to use the restroom.

Not a problem but please speak to your customers with some level of respect. Not yelling or sounding extremely annoyed."
4365,19,2 days ago,3 stars,Very busy spot people begging at the door for money and at least they opened the upstairs and the bathrooms again so you can actually sit and eat without stressing where to go after you order. Very clean did exactly what I asked for my order and always friendly. Been going here for a while when I used to work around the corner before the whole COVID-19 changed everything. But it's a place if I'm around that area I'd walk there to eat instead of Checkers   or 99cent pizza depend if your in the mood for it.
4366,19,7 months ago,5 stars,"The variety of food offered by this restaurant is great! They also value their customers, always making sure that our needs are met and we are happy with the service.. McDonalds - Thanks a lot!"

After I got back from the bathroom, it was my girlfriends turn, and they refused to allow her until I began raising my voice. ""It's not closed, I just went!!"" I said ... ""Customers only"" they tried telling me.  so I showed them my unopened food and said give me my money back for this **** then. They let her use the BR. Apparently they play games with the bathroom because there's so many homeless people around. One even asked me for money *inside the mcdonalds* as we were leaving."
4370,19,10 months ago,3 stars,"On Canal St very busy, so expect a line inside . The kiosk machines help order ahead. Homeless people are around but not inside. They are only trying to get a meal, no problem. Charity is a blessing to those less fortunate."

4373,19,a year ago,3 stars,"Good place just to grab some food and eat outside for a cheap price. Respectfully homeless people come inside to beg often. Not really a family place. If two guys are hanging it is okay. The workers are not really attentive, so check your orders."

But had no sign in sight stating that, I started to buy something else but instead Il just pray for them instead we just left I would never spend anything else there at that location."

My gripe is that my server preparing my coffee dropped my lid on the floor and lookroceeded to place it on the coffee and hand it to me. So I kindly but firmly asked, "" Didn't you just dropped that on the floor?"" She gave a look like, ""Oh I did, walked over to the garbage & dumped it. I should hve called the manager but she gave me no problem. Just wondering if she has a habit with other items dropping & giving it to customersï¿½ï"
4385,19,10 months ago,1 star,"The service of a terrible McDonald's is so bad that I can only call her that. I'm not racist, but when I meet this kind of executive manager, I think the executives of this company will come out to manage it and never go again."
4386,19,7 months ago,1 star,the attention in this place is horrible.  the serving staff is really rude and unfriendly.  I do not recommend going to this branch of mc donald.  Your experience will be stressful
4387,19,11 months ago,4 stars,Good prompt service as one would expect from them. Only negative is that the soda fountain is still closed and they still only offer bottled soda which is more expensive and not cold.

4393,19,a year ago,1 star,"I don't expect much when I visit a McDonald's, but this location certainly is one of the worst I've visited in the city.
The employees are incredibly rude, the failed to get either of my orders correct, and there seems to be a consistent encampment of homeless near the entrance that the staff don't seem to care about."
4394,19,a year ago,3 stars,"Had a few McD sundeas and mcflurrys while in NY. Long waits and always busy. But if you need a break, WC, WiFi or an ice cream, it's there. Bigger portion sizes then Europe and lots more expensive too. Mango smoothie very good"

4405,19,3 years ago,3 stars,"I am not happy with how dirty the bathrooms and the place is kept, it is so awful that you should avoid it at all costs.
I give three stars because it is very busy for majority of day so staff can be overwhelmed with all the young people causing such reckless messes in disregards to the hardworking staff and employees. However the staff are rarely friendly and difficult to communicate with. I felt that if my order was wrong and I told the man that took my order he would just explode on me.
I felt on edge, uncomfortable, and the place was dirty

I think the staff are overworked and need more employees considering the traffic this place sees."
4406,19,9 months ago,4 stars,"Hasn't had soda fountain for awhile, pretty fast and friendly. Always busy though, don't expect a seat."
4407,19,a year ago,3 stars,McDonald's is McDonald's but they have a good 2 for $6 special.  There is no where to sit and the soda fountains are out of service.  There are always homeless people hanging outside begging for money.  Can get crowded depending on what time you go

4412,19,3 years ago,3 stars,"Visited a couple of times while in the area for civil court and the staff behind the counter are usually great, but the security guy in the lobby or the floor manager or whatever blocked me trying to leave with my drink, telling me the sitting area was upstairs when i was literally just trying to leave. When I sat down here this morning a manager started harassing a customer who was sitting with a cup of coffee, calling him homeless, telling him he had to leave in 10 minutes and causing an argument between the guy and another customer, and just walked away while they yelled at each other. Not very cool ï¿½ï"

4418,19,2 years ago,5 stars,The service is always very good. The food is always served fresh and very hot. It's delicious. I enjoy all the meals in this McDonald's. The Milk Shakes are a dream come true. The staff is very friendly and the establishment is very clean. I highly recommend this McDonald's.
4419,19,3 years ago,4 stars,"Great family friendly, entertaining teenage students too. But... The toilets are too horribly maintained., Smelly, No mirrors... used Tissue were heaped openly- Very non hygienic. May be the management is too busy & short staffed ? ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
4420,19,a year ago,5 stars,Clean and functional with working kiosks. I always advise that the McDonald's App is great for deals and ordering ahead but of course at times the place can be very busy.
4421,19,8 months ago,5 stars,Always a dependable place to have a quick meal. Food was as good in New York as in L.A.!
4422,19,3 months ago,1 star,Woman behind counter very rude.
4423,19,a year ago,1 star,Bad service and their ATM machine is a fraud be aware of that. Has a chip in the card reader slot to scan your card and bank info.
4424,19,a year ago,5 stars,It was actually a pleasant visit picking up and placing an order.  The staff behind the counter this morning were very friendly.
4425,19,3 years ago,2 stars,"The food was fresh and hot. The service was quick and the restaurant was clean.  Maybe it's McDonald's policy, but why do you have to ask for ketchup, salt and pepper? And then there's none of that in the seating area either. I go upstairs, find a seat, take my food out of the bag, and no condiments! To get some, I'd have to pack my food up and go back downstairs for some frickin ketchup! No other fast food place is like that."
4426,19,4 years ago,3 stars,"It was a fast stop, we ordered using a touch screen, which was very fast and easy, you can pick from their full menu and change from selection real fast. It was an order for two and we had no issues, you can pay using your credit card without any human interaction. chicken nuggets with a couple frappe's sealed the deal for us."
4427,19,3 years ago,5 stars,I have never been to such a clean place and what I ordered a big Mac this burger was exceptionally delicious I never seen such a well prepared burger since I was a kid the atmosphere was tranquil considering it was rush hour and service was great polite even someone from outside came in asking for money immediately manager came to check it out but the individual was gone by the time manager came upstairs which was very quick
4428,19,2 months ago,5 stars,Cool place downtown by Canal St
4429,19,3 years ago,3 stars,Food was typical McDonalds. As far as the location goes it's very busy. It's usually a fight to find a table especially since the 3rd floor isn't always open. The restaurant was pretty clean considering how busy they were but the restroom was horrible. Felt like I needed a shower after using it. If you eat here hold your restroom break for later.
4430,19,5 months ago,3 stars,Decent but fountain soda broke
4431,19,4 years ago,1 star,This place is the absolute pits. I have never experienced such poor management. The space can not hold the patrons. We were definitely at capacity and then some. Theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re three floors and yet my dad and autistic daughter had to eat in the corner like slaves. You see my daughter is very routine so she is use to getting her happy meal and then sitting down to eat. At this location no one is
4432,19,4 years ago,4 stars,"It's McDonald's. You kinda know what to expect. One thing you should be prepared for if you're not a native of Manhattan, it's very pricy. I guess paying for the N.Y. rent causes the prices to be higher than what we have in Texas. The service was fast and organized, despite being very busy, just don't expect to get your usual meal for your usual price. Happy travels!"
4433,19,a year ago,4 stars,Good service but a lot of strange people entering the store. People asking for money in aggressive way and the people in line ordering food looked concerned.

4436,19,3 years ago,5 stars,So just to clarify I did not actually eat here BUT I am from the south and a huge fan of sweet tea! Also everywhere you go around here water bottles are around $3. We went to this McDonalds in hopes of finding sweet tea in NYC and we were successful! You have to get it from behind the counter but it was good and only $1 for a large just like back home. Cheapest drink I had our whole trip!
4437,19,4 years ago,5 stars,"Pretty good space employees are nice and courteous. Bathrooms are quite clean and all in all, this place is seated/ built well. Chairs are nice and comfortable. Overall, I recommend this place to others"
4438,19,3 years ago,1 star,I entered to the restaurant and immediately a black guy with black clothes told me with a rude attitude that I need to buy something. I tell him that's ok then I start watching the Menu and 3 minutes later the same guy with a rude attitude again and raising his voice told me that if I do not buy anything right away I need to leave the building. By far the worst experience in a fast food at my Life.
4439,19,5 years ago,2 stars,"The food & service is excellent & if you are taking the food out it's great. However if you plan to stay & eat inside, there are many homeless people inside & the odors from the bathrooms dies not make it pleasant. Must clean up the odors inside if they want me back"
4440,19,5 years ago,1 star,Service sucks!!!! Customer service needs to definitely improve with the workers. Tables dirty I asked a worker to wipe the table off so my family and I could eat he told me No. Therefore I went and got napkins to clean the table while he stood around. First and last visit not to mention I'm a visitor from another state.

4445,19,3 years ago,5 stars,"I love these lashes! My lashes are very short and very straight. The light glam lashes give a full look and gives me so much volume. People always ask me if my lashes are real and I tell them yeap, I use castor oil and drink a lot of water lol!!"
4446,19,a year ago,3 stars,Typical New York city McDonald's experience. Staff is very welcoming and everyone has a hairnet on today wow even the managers.
4447,19,5 years ago,1 star,Beware they are not 24 hours. I've stopped here several time in the early am hours and the door was locked. The workers were inside and wouldn't even come to the door. They yelled 6 oclock. So much for 24 hours. When it is open it surrounded by homeless people inside and out. They might as well turn it into a homeless shelter.
4448,19,3 years ago,4 stars,"ýýýýýýýý Happy ýýýý Thanksgiving 2019. ýýýýýýýý

This McDonaldýýýs located at 262 Canal Street, in Chinatown, New York City have been here for ages.

All McDonaldýýýs are created equal in terms of cleanliness, so it is no surprise that it is very clean, neat, tidy and spotlessly clean.

It is a huge McDonaldýýýs because it has 3 stories, but on the second and third floor, there is a limited number of chairs.  Poor design left it with about 40 to 50 seats on the 2 top floors.

The staff is very professional, friendly and polite with a smile, and there are staff who are bilingual {English and Chinese) (English and Spanish).

Enjoy  Mickey Dýýýs  and

A Happy Thanksgiving."
4449,19,11 months ago,2 stars,"Update: it's so frustrating to eat here! There is a virtual army of panhandlers from the nice guy who opens the door for you to the more aggressive ones that approach you as you order, or eat your food. In addition, the place is still disorganized and dirty.  That's McDonald's in New York.  Management at this location is pretty lame."
4450,19,3 years ago,1 star,"I ordered a 6 piece chicken nuggets and when I get to my room I open the box to only find 4. They rip you off, check before you leave! Also, employees may follow you outside while saying insults towards you even if you patiently wait."
4451,19,3 years ago,5 stars,The service was quick..courteous and easy...they also have a self order kiosk which makes ordering quick and simple...by the time you get to the casheier ur order is filled...  The is a ATM machine and bathrooms upstairs. .a nice place with plenty of table space on the second floor...enjoy!!!!
4452,19,4 years ago,4 stars,"The restaurant is kept clean and service is fast. It's like the usual McDonald's you'd expect, but better. However, the food there is slightly priced higher than usual prices at different McDonald's. Overall, I'd recommend."
4453,19,7 years ago,1 star,"The cashier successfully scammed my change. Well, I guess she needed the money. It is not about the meager change, but the idea that they would scam a paying customer. I will never come back here ever again, worst experience ever!"
4454,19,6 months ago,1 star,Awful place to visit in ugly new York City waste of time
4455,19,3 years ago,4 stars,"Wonderful view over Broadway/ Central Park. Service is very good. You take a tablenumber, place your order yourself and no matter which floor you sit and wait for your order to be brought to you, they'll find you. Amazing."
4456,19,5 months ago,1 star,They was so unpleasant at pickup
4457,19,3 years ago,4 stars,Good place for a quick bite. Their menu has gotten better. They will add new items to their menu every few months which is very nice of them to keep attracting customers.
4458,19,4 years ago,5 stars,"This, location/different, 20 years ago, this place, was once, tourist, haunted, land, N, R, NO.6, subway exit, CANAL street, people flow, and popularity, prosperity, McDonald's It is also one, young, male and female, especially many, brought, youth, breath, order, this place, a lot of color, that year, my favorite is happy meal, there are many fathers, bring children here, enjoy ."
4459,19,4 years ago,5 stars,"At 3AM it is like an oasis in the desert!! We originally went in to use the bathroom but ended up getting soft drinks, felt guilty using their facilities without buying anything.... filthy bathrooms but very courteous staff and interesting clientele!! As with all McD's, NO PAPER TOWELS in restrooms... BUT for what it is (McD's), it is 5 star."
4460,19,6 years ago,3 stars,"Surrounding is not clean, tables have trash on them left by customers. Needs someone on the upper level to clean up tables. There were no napkins or ketchup upstairs for customers to use. Burgers being served without lettuce and tomato you now have to purchase this and when you do its very tiny pieces. The burger meals are over priced. Service was on acceptable. We have to be sitting in a dirty, untidy and unattractive area. Worst of all why is there a sign in the restaurant telling customers you only have 30mins to eat and leave, like really. That sign needs to be removed. Not returning to this restaurant. Fix up and clean up the place."
4461,19,4 years ago,2 stars,"Stopped here to get a quick bite, the place looks very dirty. Homeless people in the entrance and inside. The 2nd floor smelled like piss. Just go here if you want to go to the bathroom or are really really hungry!"
4462,19,6 months ago,5 stars,A great place to socialize with my friends
4463,19,5 years ago,2 stars,this location has 3 floors but usually only 2 are accessible to customers. wouldn't recommend eating here and strongly suggest taking your order to go as the crowds of tourists and locals make it hard to find a seat.
4464,19,5 years ago,5 stars,This is the best dang McDonald's in NEW YORK CITY. It has bathrooms with stalls that are very clean. It smells of Big Macs and hope. What a wonderful discovery during my visit to Chinatown. God bless Ronald Mcdonald.
4465,19,3 years ago,4 stars,"It was absolutely amazing!!! I went around closing time and it was no waiting time to be seated and my server Ty , was amazing!!!!! I had a great time and the drinks do it for me every time!!!! Hands own one of my favorite places to eat and drink!!"
4466,19,3 years ago,1 star,"While the map said that this place is open 24 hours, we came to find the doors locked with a bunch of people casually hanging out/eating/drinking inside at 1am. The staff told us they're closed, even though they were not supposed to be."
4467,19,4 years ago,2 stars,The automated machine didn't print us a receipt so I told one of the employees who was nice enough to look up the number.  The problem was I had no reference to chek the order.  I spent almost 50 dollars for 3 kids and 2 adults.  I walked 5 blocks to get that food bbn order and when I got back to our job I discovered we were missing chicken nuggets and all the dipping sauces.  I ordered 6 sauces and we got none.  It really pisses me off because they always leave stuff out when we order large orders.  It's like they can only handle it if u have a simple meal.  It's so frustrating and plus it's like throwing 10.oo out the window..  you really need to be better about training your workers.
4468,19,5 years ago,4 stars,"This review is on their bathroom and small fries for obvious reasons.
So glad this place is 24hours.... I needed to use their bathroom so badly at ~10pm. I ordered a small fries and ran upstairs....there was toilet paper, which is a huuuge plus-- but their mirror...I think someone stole it or something. There is just hand soap on the wall and where the mirror should be, were just screw holes...? LOL WELP"
4469,19,3 years ago,5 stars,"The location is alway clean despite always being busy.  My food always comes out hot (huge plus for me).  I ordered the fillet-o fish sandwich, and a small dr.pepper.
I live near a McDonald's in Brooklyn, but the food quality sucks.  So despite living closer to the Brooklyn location, I would rather get my food from this location and travel home to eat it. Lol"
4470,19,6 years ago,1 star,From a disabled stand point this would not be an ideal dining experience.  There isn't any designated areas for wheelchair customers. Staff are not equipped to handle a wheelchair customers. The one area where someone with a wheelchair chair could sit is next to the entrance the bathroom and the order kiscos and quite popular waiting area set up for customers waiting for their order.
4471,19,5 years ago,3 stars,It's ok but so crowded by the cashier because it's small!
4472,19,5 years ago,1 star,"On May 6,2018 , I ordered my coffee by using online app at 6:30 am . I went to this location to pick up my order at 6:45 am , and then one employee at cashier who did not want to give me my order , because he didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t see it on screen . I showed him see my online receipt include the number of order that I paid it by using my bank account . I asked him to help me to check on the system for make sure , but he did not want to help me . After waited for 5 mins, it showed off on the screen."
4473,19,4 years ago,2 stars,"I am not that pleased with, McD. The ice cream is nice. What I don't like about a lot fast food places; is that the ongoing clean up process is sometimes flat out disgusting. Who wants the crumbs from the table next to you; in your food, or getting dirty mop water inside your shoes, because they are mopping under the same table your trying to finish your meal?"
4474,19,4 years ago,2 stars,"The service is slow.. 60/40 if the food taste good. And anything more then the 1,2,3 dollar menu the taste aint worth the price.. I think being extremely slow is a all McDonald's requirement tho."
4475,19,3 years ago,5 stars,It's a McDonald as you would expect. Great if you want a quick bite but if you want a good meal go somewhere else. This location was just fine. Service was great and the food arrived fast.
4476,19,6 months ago,3 stars,"Busy and crowded, took the chill from our bones ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
4477,19,a year ago,3 stars,Holy. The prices at this McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s is crazy astronomical compared to others. The promotional Saweetie Meal is priced at $13.89 here!! Even in hotspots like Macyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï
4478,19,5 years ago,2 stars,"No tissues what so ever, not clean...lot of tourists from chinatown tour travel. It is simply shame on McDonalds to do these 3rd class services...confused and disconnected staff. Felt like there was only one person working who looked like a team leader...all employees making team leader work..pity on him."
4479,19,6 years ago,2 stars,"I've worked in the neighborhood for decades and this was always a decent go to place for a late night snack.

A couple of years ago they modified the interior- they removed a lot of seats on the main floor in order to install electronic order kiosks.  There are now only a handful of places to sit in a ridiculously cramped manner.  Late at night they close the upstairs- leaving pretty much nowhere decent to sit and eat.  Tonight I saw two people eating over the garbage cans and one eating by the soda dispenser.

The kiosks are annoying.  They ask if you want to take out or eat there.  If you select ""Eat In"", before you can pay for your order you're asked to get a table marker and enter the marker number.  Thing is there are absolutely no table markers- you cannot complete your order without one- unless you start over and select ""take out"".

During the day perhaps eating in makes sense- but late at night it's really only for take out."
4480,19,5 months ago,4 stars,My kids like eat Macdonald
4481,19,10 months ago,1 star,"THERE'S NO CODE FOR THE BATHROOM! Just walk up to the second floor.

Horrible customer service, rudest people ever."
4482,19,11 years ago,3 stars,"They renovated their store and it's very nice and modern. They staff is pretty much like all the other fast food chain out there (high school kids working part time), so nothing out of the ordinary. They have free wifi, so you can definitely take advantage of the service and surf the web while enjoying a sweet tea or something. They have the basic dollar menu - sweet tea, apple pies, apple dippers, cone and some other things, but too bad they don't have the chicken sandwich or McDouble for a dollar. The seating area can get packed sometimes and they don't always open the third floor to the public, although it really doesn't fit that many people, but sometimes you would have to wait a while for someone to finish before you can get a table and seat."
4483,19,3 years ago,1 star,It's hard to give them any stars because we didnt get to eat there. For what is advertised as open 24 hrs they were closed all 3 x I tried to go there this weekend.  Very dissatisfied
4484,19,6 years ago,4 stars,"It's much cleaner now than it used to be. They also have touchscreen monitors you can order from now, which is convenient. I found things that I never knew was on the menu!"
4485,19,4 years ago,2 stars,"This place is more of a homeless shelter than a fast food restaurant. There is an upstairs seating area, which apparently only opens when the employees deem necessary. There is literally nowhere to sit here. Take- out only."
4486,19,5 years ago,3 stars,"The burger my husband had was fine however, my chicken sandwich was disgusting. It tasted old and hard. The fries and sweet tea were the same as any other McDonalds, obviously fresh because it sees extremely heavy traffic. The ordering kiosks are super convient but you can't customize -- as in you can't take onions or tomatoes off of your sandwich, and of course no cash payments are accepted unless you go to the actual counter. Seating is not well arranged but being 3 stories tall it can fit about 100 people. I wouldn't go back..."
4487,19,3 years ago,5 stars,I have to admit to be so late and night and cheating on my never ending diet the McDonald's was clean friendly fresh fries and so welcoming. Now I cant say this for all McDonald's but I had to share it was a very pleasant experience.
4488,19,3 years ago,3 stars,Its hit or miss here. Sometimes its fast sometimes it takes forever to get your food. The one thing I must say is unlike other mcdonalds they always get your order right so that is definitely a plus. It is a little more expensive too because it's in Manhattan/Chinatown. If you go to the bronx or brooklyn it cost you less.
4489,19,2 years ago,4 stars,"Today, one of my items was forgotten, but I will check in tomorrow about it for a replacement. Otherwise, pleasant staff and quick service."
4490,19,6 years ago,4 stars,"Have a couple kiosks in the front _ easy and nice to use. Lots of customizable things to the order. Make sure you scroll to the bottom and check out the deals and promotions. Order was prepared pretty quickly and correct. No big complaints, about as good an experience that McDonalds can be.

Pro tip: on the kiosk when you are checking out and it asks for your ""location code""... Just click 'cancel'. It's an error in the system."
4491,19,4 years ago,1 star,I was forced to buy something just because I had to use the restroom. SMH I understand that some business do that but really . No thank you plus manager was rushing everyone.

4496,19,3 years ago,1 star,"The worst McDonalds ever in the world.Having already spended 12 dollars in coffees i was waiting for a friend for food.The manager insulted me and told me to go outside because i wasnt consuming .My friend came at that time so he made us the favour to let us eat there.
We spended 50 more dollars and after 1 hour he told us to go out again because you can eat only 30 minutes.The whole time the shop was half empty....At the next table a guy was eating duck from home having only a coka cola and no one told him anything.....DONT GO THERE"

4501,19,5 years ago,3 stars,"I asked for an egg white delight but they were ""out"" so I got an egg McMuffin and a sweet tea. The egg was underdone and still runny. The tea was not sweet it just had sugar added to unsweetened tea."
4502,19,4 years ago,1 star,"when I was here it was during a rainstorm and the inside was very wet and dirty. It was also very crowded, as a lot of tourists and other people come here to try to use the bathroom for free. It was impossible to find a place to sit to eat my snack."

I'm also not a sushi person. I love as six mc Donald's for their cheap juicy burger, fast orders and cheap shakes, or if I'm feeling like I want something lighter ony stomach and it's late, a grilled chicken salad, side asald or parfait is great. Excellent for my son, who asks for the yogurt in his kids meal. The mozzarella sticks is also a perfect edition. Their coffee exceeds bk and I loved this location wen visiting last month. Quick easy and clean with upstairs seating. The workers for friendly and helped me when they forgot a drink."
4512,19,7 years ago,1 star,"Place used to be great. Now they have beggars & the homeless have taken over almost the entire 2nd floor. Place smells horrid. The employees are rude, food takes so long."

4519,19,7 years ago,1 star,"It's a sad state of affairs when you buy an ice cream sundae to get access to the McDonalds bathroom and not only is the sundae prepared wrong (the hot fudge isn't supposed to just get dumped on top of the ice cream; that's gotta be, like, day 1 of McDonalds training...), but the bathroom clearly hasn't been cleaned in weeks."

The area was clean enough (and I am particular about that), the kiosks were in working order besides one but it didn't hold up the orders at all.  Food deals were clearly marked,  the ordering system wasn't correct as you usually grab a tent and go to a table but one of the staff saw us wondering about it and told us to just put a number in... so they were clearly attentive to what was going on around them.  Food came out quickly.  Same cost for food as any other mcdonalds anywhere.  Great, quick,  cheap food for a late evening."

It is safe to avoid this restaurant if you don't want to suffer a racist encounter. Deeply disappointed that an establishment like McDonalds would hire people like this guy"

We ended up talking and catching__till my battery ran out. As I was starting to get ready with my homework, one of the staffs told me that I have been there for more than 5 hours __I was like, ""really?. "" He said yes, and I was supposed to stay 30 minutes only, but I was been there for more than 5 hours.

Now, I didn't exactly notice what time I came in but when I look on the time it was around 6pm or so. I asked the security guard if I can stay to do my homework, he said ""I'm sorry"".

I understand they were just doing their job. So, I left. When I was outside, I was, ""hey, I could have bought another food and stay!"" Anyways, I just left"
4607,22,a week ago,1 star,"Apparently people are not permitted to go to the washroom,  clean up, and reset prior to ordering.   I like my food hot and don't agree with this store policy.  The manager wouldn't acknowledge me beyond a smirk.  I asked for permission,  she said nothing but a worker from behind the counter restated the policy.  A quarter-mile away, my preferred sequence worked golden.  Literally,  a STUPID policy implemented by that store and manager."

An African American worker in a grey shirt (Male) with braided hair was incredibly racist to her and her friends, using an Asian accent when talking to them. He was originally on the side and took over the register from one of his coworkers on purpose with the intent of being completely racist to them. He spoke with an Asian accent ridiculing their race and telling them he can serve them for an extra $5.00. While this was happening, all of the other employees laughed and egged him on. My girlfriend and her friends felt very unsafe, especially late at night. We will try filing a police report today with the local precinct and hope this employee faces consequences."

The surprising thing was there was homeless folks inside the store walking and smoking next to us when we were preparing to eat. The homeless guy was even asking for food to someone next to us. It felt very much like a 3rd world country's experience. The tables were dirty as well - maybe they need to hire more people for cleaning in between customers. The French fries were cold as well, as if they were probably heated long time ago. Also, the store associates should provide a tray for customers who are going to be sitting/eating inside the store instead of paper packets for takeouts."

Worse, they did not contain the extra pickles I requested 3 times! Yes 3 x. The 2 Apple pies were not only cold ...but ,worse, had been clearly sitting out all day and were so over cooked,  I just  spit them out and into the garbage;  less than 1 bite.
The chicken sandwich was not hot either  and worse , it was waaaay overly smeared  with unhealthy  mayo which  I threw away so as to not suffer food poisoning. It was by far the worst fast food restaurant experience ever in my life and it cost me a whopping  9 dollars and 93 cents. I WANT A REFUND PLEASE.

FINALLY ,this crowded McDonald's  was the filthiest and dirtiest one I've ever been in.

So very very sad and disappointed.

She was doing nothing but standing there she don't want to take my order and keep telling me use the screen and refuse to help me.i verbally confronted her .there I left without my breakfast. If people like her keep working for your well known establishment you loose and get defame your good name because people like her. Teach her some manners how to behave with people ho come to your restaurant to have good time. She act like I was a homeless person. I hope you can do something about this incident.

They finally got there but the perpetrators had left. Very scary experience.

4680,22,2 years ago,5 stars,Very clean not crowded food was actually hot
4681,22,a year ago,1 star,"I've been more than patient with this place. I understand this is a tough area to work because I work near this restaurant. At this point closing so early randomly is unacceptable. It's like you are gambling with the little time you have for break. And the site says 24 hours, and still no dining??? They have security, so dodging the seedy types should not be an issue here."
4682,22,a year ago,1 star,I have never seen such a disgraceful service in my life. workers are very rude. That woman at the cash register shouldn't be standing there. should get out of work. You can't treat customers like dogs. who are you ?

Despite the fact that itýýýs front sign explicitly says ýýýOpen 24/7ýýý, they unethically keep the doors tide shut from the inside, based on a made-up rule that you have to show proof of an order from your ýýýý phone. Even if your phone is dead, in the middle of the night, and youýýýre starving, they still wonýýýt let you simply walk inside to order, like everyone else in America. This is place is bad for business. DONýýýT bother."
4685,22,a year ago,4 stars,"PROS: This McDonalds is located right next to Madison Square garden making it an easy stop right before or after the game. They are also very clean and the staff seemed to be nice. The food came fast compared to other fast food places in the city

CONS: The touchscreens that you order your food on had a tough time scanning the vaccine card and the place was small inside compared to other fast food places.

OVERALL: Great place near the garden but isn't my go-to when I hit that area of the city"
4686,22,7 months ago,1 star,Terrible experience.  Filthy.  No soda at all.  Staff could not have been ruder if they tried.
4687,22,2 years ago,4 stars,"Staff is nice and they are fast to get the food out. I only go in the morning for breakfast on the way to work. Only issues are the norm in many places. they don't clean the kiosks often and they are no wipes to do it yourself, and have to be careful of people crowded by the doors."
4688,22,3 months ago,5 stars,Very  good clean restaurant ï¿½ï
4689,22,a year ago,4 stars,Your typical McDonald's. Which is generally why people visit McDonald's all around the world. Consistency. Could be a little cleaner. But nothing that would turn one off. Reasonable experience. Reasonable service. With expected pricing.

4691,22,a year ago,2 stars,"Looked like it could have done with some more staff.

Dude handing out the food just marked random ones as gone even though he didn't announce the numbers.

We had to go ask for ours. It was just chilling there.

But it's McDonald's. If you're going, you're going to go regardless of the rating."
4692,22,a month ago,2 stars,To many homelessness are in this franchise it is quite disgusting
4693,22,a year ago,1 star,"Security worker said we could not eat our food inside and was very disrespectful, started taking a video of us and making rude comments while doing so. Made us go outside during a severe thunderstorm after purchasing our food. No sign saying anything about no eating inside the restaurant. Guy just had a power trip and probably upset how his life sucks"
4694,22,a year ago,4 stars,It is great thant you can actually eat inside the place no like many other restaurants in the area at the moment because of the omicron variant. The bad thing it's that the personal in these particular McDonald's is slow... you're going to have to wait for your food at least 5 to 10 minutes..... It is the price you have to pay if you want to eat inside haha
4695,22,6 months ago,5 stars,"Nice place, service is very quick and great atmosphere"
4696,22,a year ago,5 stars,I ordered a coffee the service was super fast and just how I like it. The people behind the counter were so nice and easy. It even came along with a smile and a thank you.
4697,22,2 years ago,4 stars,Not too busy everything was clean and service was good wait time wasn long even though their was a decent amount of customers. And food was fresh as could be for fast food. Also not one employee was rude. Good visit and would recommend this one over some others in area.
4698,22,a year ago,3 stars,Restaurant was clean and there were social distancing. It's what you normally expected from a fast food joint. Prices were little higher than normal but it is in Manhattan so that's to be expected. Service was quick when I went there in off hours.
4699,22,a month ago,1 star,very very dirty and broken tables and benches

4702,22,3 months ago,1 star,It stank in this facility. How is food even served
4703,22,a year ago,1 star,"Horrible! Avoid this place at night.  Unsafe.  Panhandling at the counter and hooligans will take your food the second it is ready for pick up, they won't even call your number. Staff and security could care less."
4704,22,a year ago,5 stars,"Almost always a scene here.. impatient people, sometimes some yelling goes down..but I always get my order in fast and easy. If there's a line, use the digital kiosk. If not, use the human. Never waited more than 5 min here for a big Mac or double."
4705,22,3 years ago,4 stars,"Pretty clean place, crowded of course but that can be overseen when you find a table. Service is pretty speedy, got my food pretty quickly. Security by the bathroom though, need your receipt just to use it. Gets annoying hearing ""ma'am wait, sir your receipt?"" ""You need a receipt"". Tip, don't throw away your receipt until you leave, and don't sit next to the bathroom if you don't wanna hear that everytime a person tries to enter the bathroom."
4706,22,6 months ago,5 stars,McDonald's is always clean and serves fresh fast food
4707,22,7 months ago,1 star,DO NOT I REPEAT DO NO NOT GO THERE!!! ONE OF THE WORST MC IN THE CITY. EVERY MORNING THEY NEVER HAVE MOBILE OR REGISTERS ITS SUCH A INCONVENIENCE. LIKE WHY ARE YOU OPEN???????????????????
4708,22,a year ago,2 stars,To crowded and not safe with homeless and drug addicts hanging out inside. The good was not the same as other establishments. Very disappointing with good and service. Last time going there.
4709,22,4 years ago,5 stars,Was there with my 2 year old(kids meal 4 piece chicken nuggets). I was attempting to use the kiosk when one of the employees a young lady came immediately to assist. She explained the process and took me to a register to check out. Within 4 minutes I had placed my order and had my food. Wonderful service though there were a lot of customers. Wonderful experience.
4710,22,a year ago,2 stars,Chances of being stuck by a hypodermic needle are pretty high at this location.  Restaurant is full with people you really wouldn't feel comfortable eating next too.

4712,22,a year ago,1 star,Supervisor is a mean person that every time she has a argument somebody get hurt is really incompetent and if I'm lying look for all there latest news. And you will find tha the first with her and a client and it end security harming people. I am so sorry to say this. I was a suing manager in McDonald's when I was younger and there are better ways to handle situations.
4713,22,3 years ago,1 star,"""Payment Warning!"" The non-American foreigners who run this restaurant is the only McDonald's in United States that do not accept Discover Card for payment."
4714,22,3 years ago,2 stars,"The staff who work there have no manners whatsoever. I go there everyday on my break and when it's time to pickup my order it's just a ""here you go.""
I'm always polite and always say thank you even though no one ever says anything back.
At this point I'd rather talk to a robot than anyone who works there.
I'd probably get better service."
4715,22,a year ago,5 stars,"Normally all the Macdonald's are the same. They have to keep the standard what is the Franchise of the Macdonald's request from who is getting enter to be one the franchise one..  For me the best item they have in their menu is the ""French fries ï¿½ï"".
I love to Go  around the many places in the world.  And enjoy one of the fries. Sometimes they introduced a new drink. Now they are getting innovated  and you can order your food  in the internet. Delivered to you by IFood."

4718,22,a year ago,1 star,Worst service I ever experienced. I ordered one thing but cashier decided to sell me double of what he thought was better. When I asked for my money back Angel the shift manager was very rude verbally and physically. I will never be going to that establishment again.
4719,22,4 years ago,4 stars,"Very friendly staff! The cashier right away greeted us and asked what we would like to order. She was also very helpful explain the offers that were available. Service was fast, quick and extremely efficient. Waiting time was less than 5 minutes. Good fast food spot for a quick bite to eat! They also offer order yourself service and of course on the app too! Food was good. The only reason I couldn't give this McDonald's a 5 stars was because many tables and chairs to eat in were a bit dirty. Also, the restrooms were dirty it could have been better other than that #eatoutside and don't forget if you like my review please give it a thumbs up!"
4720,22,a year ago,4 stars,Have to say they finally up the game recently & put security in the establishment to prevent certain unwanted people taking up seats early in the mng. sleeping & leaving a mess! That no longer currently exists as i have seen the change myself! Don't hesitate to enter the establishment for breakfast ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
4721,22,2 years ago,4 stars,"Great service. Clean. Unfortunately, they have seedy people that love hanging out on the side walk. This is not Mc Donald's fault. However, I feel safe and satisfied with the pace of service."

4723,22,9 months ago,4 stars,"Thank you guys, for your job and the effort to keep the place at the nice level, even sometimes becomes messy, but you always were friedly and ready to prepare my food order ( not the healthiest option tho ), but you always saved me from starving"
4724,22,a year ago,4 stars,"It's a decent McDonald's.  The issue is its location,  it's  a high tourist area and hub for New Yorkers to do a lot of shopping or transferring bus/trains. That also comes with people who are on drugs, homeless and so on. But it's not that bad"
4725,22,2 years ago,1 star,"This is what I encountered when I came to this location today.  A trash bag wrapped around the door by the security guard to stop ppl from coming in.   So instead of a safe, warm location to order and pickup from, I had to wait on a very dangerous Avenue in NYC while they took their sweet time in making my order.  20 minutes to make breakfast and having to wait on a dangerous street is ABSOLUTELY APPALING"
4726,22,2 years ago,1 star,"They were careful about maintaining social distancing, an encouraging sign.  However, because of the nature of the area, and the poor getting poorer, and the homeless getting braver, several times while waiting on line to order and to pick up, seemingly homeless/desperate people came in begging, some pretending to order, some appeared to be casing the customers.  It was disturbing to say the least. On top of all of that, the meals I had ordered were cold and the french fries limp and cold. I would never go there again."

4728,22,2 years ago,2 stars,"This review is in 2 parts: 1st the dining area and bathroom and 2nd the behind the counter crew and food.
1st...this Mc Donald's seemed to have their own guidlines for COVID-19. And the guidlines they followed were NONE or ZERO. The place was VERY crowded.NO social distancing. NO one to monitor or count how many people were allowed in. it  did not feel or look clean or a safe environment ...good to  spread germs and viruses.
alot of people from the street who were not customers just hanging around using many tables and  shoulder to shoulder in the seats. people passed out in the chairs with masks pulled off. They had ONE dining room person who just could not keep up with the mess that they were leaving. The bathroom was a horror show: obviously people were washing and cleaning more than just their hands inside. was dirty.
2nd,..the saving grace of the restaurant was the cashier, the food expediter and the employees making the food. they were all very fast, pleasant, thanked me, and the food was hot, fresh and very good.

Dining area and bathroom: 0 (zero) stars

Behind the counter employees and food: 4 stars

Combined and average:  2 stars"
4729,22,4 years ago,4 stars,Very clean decent bathroom.   Lots of lost soles during the week hanging out.  But they are kept low and behaved. Bathroom is kept clean and decent and they have a wall of ordering terminals to is. I do suggest using an app and having it ready rather then the touch screen. They have a long delay and it's a bit to order.
4730,22,11 months ago,5 stars,Love to get my breakfast from this Mcdonald store. The coffee and tea is the best. I also like their pancakes and sausage.
4731,22,a month ago,1 star,Full of dropouts. Take care
4732,22,5 years ago,3 stars,I work pretty close to this location but I try to avoid it because of the sheer amount of homeless and drug users that visit the establishment.  The lines are not usually long but they are very disorganized and the wait time for can take over 15 minutes for just a sandwich. The food/promotions was on par with other locations.
4733,22,a year ago,2 stars,"McDonald's is fast food not because it's good but a quick cup of coffee ok.
Don't expect much as far as food! The
worst thing really is the ordering and waiting to get what you ordered!! Worse McDonald's is 8th Ave 35st! Very bad staff! I asked for a straw I had dropped mine no no no I said I'll pay for it never got the straw lol! You will live eating the food get ready for

Now they are on the $1 $2 $3 Menu and they are $3 each.  The McChicken had Mayo only on a far side and it was all over the wrapper and top of the bun.  Almost NONE was in the sandwich.  I ate it though, but it tasted funny.  The McDouble was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  The bread was stale and hard.  The meat was cold.  It was a 1 out of 10 burger.  It was that bad.  I couldn't eat it so I threw it away.  I wish I could get my money back.  McDonalds is a failure at this point."

4744,22,2 years ago,1 star,The security guy was very rude. He was on his phone while I approached him and asked if it was possible to use the restroom. He was rude and said that I can use only with a purchase which I agreed to. I humbly asked if I can use the restroom first before I make the purchase and he raised his voice at me and said u keep asking me the same thing. No humanity.!!

However, this review is based solely on the location. 8th Avenue has a SERIOUS homeless problem, and the restaurant is always swarmed with them. If it were just that they were begging for change, I could forgive it. Unfortunately most of the people I've seen are out of their minds on whatever drugs and usually screaming and carrying on. They make me incredibly uneasy, to the point where I'm not comfortable eating here anymore. More than once, I've seen fights break out. Best to find another location."
4748,22,2 years ago,4 stars,I didnt have a mask cause it suddenly broke while on line and the cashier offered me a mask. I thought that was so awesome i was so happy causw they made me feel welcomed and not embrassed. The staff was pleasant and quick serving.

I would recommend it to people looking for a decent meal at a reasonable price!"

4751,22,5 years ago,2 stars,"There is a hired male guard for the bathrooms to ensure only paying customers use it, which seems overkill and made me as a customer uncomfortable. The technology of coded locks satisfy this need for other businesses in the area. Bigger concern is that a guarded bathroom was still incredibly filthy. If you're paying someone to hang around the bathroom all day, maybe also pay someone to hang around the bathroom and clean it. There was a copious amount of a vomit like substance trailing out of one of the stalls that had been there for some time and one of the two stalls didn't lock. Not cool."

4769,22,4 years ago,5 stars,Like the modern look inside and nice seating. Great atmosphere for casual Hangout with friends. Kiosk there helps when the lines are too long. Cashiers are friendly and nice.
4770,22,a year ago,5 stars,"Bathroom door lock is broken.

Went from 3 to 5 stars since it's the best looking macdo I found in NYC.
I ended up coming multiple times there.

America should reconsider what the standard is, European Mc Do are way cleaner, service is faster."
4771,22,3 years ago,3 stars,"I've been here numerous times and have no complaints about the food or the staff. As mentioned in other reviews here, there is a problem with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant and the ""transients"" that call the place ""home"".

I'm not sure if there is a homeless shelter nearby or if people just love to hang out in the place, but there are always less fortunate people there especially in the morning. Just this morning I've witnessed the NYPD escort a woman out of the restaurant that was loitering. There are signs throughout the restaurant that clearly state No Loitering and that there is a 30 min time limit. Now that the weather is getting colder, people are just looking to stay warm.

Unfortunately, McDonalds is in a difficult position. As a former General Manager of a fast food restaurant, I used to deal with ""rough"" teenagers and ""undesirables"" especially at night. I wanted my paying customers to have a friendly, warm and inviting environment to eat in with their families. The ""rough"" crowd made that very difficult to maintain. I, like McDs started with signs. The McDs in this review also has full time security to help keep the people safe and moving.

You see, you just can't stand at the door and not allow people to come into McDs. The best you can do is try to manage it. I give them a lot of credit for trying to do just that. I also give credit to the employees as they have to deal with it all day long. As far as the cleanliness, they can do a much better job there. I can't speak for all the people given Lobby Duty, but I've never seen one with a cleaning bottle and rag to clean the tables. So, even I had to sit at a table this morning that wasn't clean. It wasn't exactly disgusting, but it wasn't clean either.

I've never been in the bathrooms because I try to avoid them at all costs. I've seen the people that come out of there and also the bathrooms at Penn Station down the block. It can't be pleasant in there and frankly, I wouldn't want to clean it either.

There are other McDs in the area, but this one is at times convenient for me. You can't beat the price for breakfast in that area in NYC. I would NEVER bring my family there. But for a quick stop in the morning, it's ok.

So, the 3 stars are just for the environment, the ""ambiance"" and the cleanliness. The food and the staff are great, it's just a ""difficult"" place to eat in given the community."
4772,22,3 years ago,3 stars,Nice place. Tables should be cleaned more rapidly though. There were several empty tables when I went but here were food drops on most of them... Not quite clean
4773,22,6 months ago,4 stars,Good and fast that what you call fast food
4774,22,5 years ago,4 stars,"Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d expect a McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s near Penn Station to be pretty terrible, but theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve actually kept this location reasonably nice.

4775,22,2 years ago,5 stars,Due to the COVID pandemic things have evolved and MacDonalds is definitely updating its customer service. There are self-counters now to place orders. The service has improved for good! Great burgers!
4776,22,3 months ago,5 stars,The service was quick and easy
4777,22,3 years ago,2 stars,I had to give 2 star because I've been trying to call the phone number listed on the website multiple times and no one responded or go to voice mail with Verizon. I had few missing items that I wanted to report. The food came fast but I have had better food from McDonald's than from this location.
4778,22,a year ago,1 star,"Dirty, several people trying to sleep at tables, no vaccine check. We were desperate for food/drinks but believe this was where we contracted covid. Currently in quarantine on ship."
4779,22,a year ago,1 star,"Bad service. Couldn't find straws,  all the tables were dirty.  And went to wipe a table down and couldn't find napkins."
4780,22,4 years ago,2 stars,"Extremely busy when we visited at lunchtime, with queues at most of the automated order points, and hardly anywhere to sit once we had received our food - which was good - from the rather harassed looking staff.

Despite there being a clearly signposted No Loitering policy with a maximum 30 minutes to eat your meal, this did not seem to apply to the rather insalubrious clientele who were occupying most of the seats in the back part of the place. I hesitate to use the word ""restaurant"" to describe this outlet.

As it is almost opposite the Tick Tock Diner, which was really busy at breakfast time, we had planned to try this McDonald's for breakfast, but after today's experience, we'll give it a skip."
4781,22,3 years ago,3 stars,"It was full of junkies. I was holding onto my purse n couldn't enjoy my meal.  Finally, my daughter and I had to leave.  If I were just rating the food, it was hot n served quickly."
4782,22,5 years ago,5 stars,The people at the store we're so rude. The manager was keeping her cool. Good job. Once I actually ordered my stuff came out fast and correctly.
4783,22,2 weeks ago,2 stars,Very dirty place.
4784,22,3 years ago,3 stars,"Food was up to their standard, except the chocolate shake was thin and not frozen. But the place was a total mess with all the tables dirty and trash all over the floor, and no table numbers at the ordering kiosks. One person did come out and start sweeping before we left, but it seems some retraining may be in order for this location."
4785,22,3 years ago,2 stars,"This McDonalds restaurant was Ok. Neither more or less compared to my expectations. However, I find it on a negative side note the constant stream of homeless people entering the restaurant, causing somewhat of a commotion.

The service and the employees of the restaurant was helpful and fine."
4786,22,a month ago,1 star,Bum central avoid this one at all costs
4787,22,a year ago,5 stars,Well this McDonald's has been known through out the City as not recommended place to eat but that's are people Opion. I've known this places just like anywhere else as far as people coming in and starting problems. Any way this place I gave it a 5 cause the employees are very respectful  clean when you oder there's a couple of employee's that I like to mention. Mr. Noe is a young man that does almost everything behind the counter very respectful fast worker is important in a fast food business. Next  Rosalva  is also a very respectful employee she works behind the counter greets you with a real smile not only welcome to McDonald's and a fake smile you could tell the difference ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Third is the one that runs this place is the manager Maria. She makes sure everything is in tip top shape for the Customers friendly always trying to meet the customers request also with a great ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½to come.

From ~ BigMamaPimp"
4791,22,3 years ago,3 stars,"Attention tourists: due to the high volume of homeless people, the chain hired a rude BOUNCER. Local authorities can not handle the increasing population of unfortunate citizens living in trains stations and NOW residing on stores and/or food chains. The staff EXCEPT for that individual, is good. First time I see this type of worker at a McDonald's franchise."
4792,22,6 months ago,3 stars,"It's McDonald's, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."
4793,22,a year ago,5 stars,Good food and good service. The place was packed but the staff was friendly and very well organized.
4794,22,10 months ago,3 stars,It's dirty and to much people from the streets go there and ask people for money when people are eating and they don't smell good and is very expensive
4795,22,2 months ago,3 stars,McDonald's just isn't what it used to be.
4796,22,2 years ago,2 stars,"They botched an order. Ordered spicy chicken sandwich and they gave me a dry one. no condiment. Compete with Chick-fil-A? Yeah right, can't even compete against popeyes"
4797,22,4 years ago,4 stars,"I read the reviews and they were unkind, but it was conveniently located. Also, $1.00 coffee.  They have security to keep out the undesirables. Weird to see 2 security guards at McDonald's but I guess it is working. The place was clean and being able to order at a kiosk made the wait time short even during the breakfast rush."
4798,22,3 years ago,3 stars,The self serve stations dont have table tags so you go through the motions only to get stuck and have to go to the counter or know to put in a random number to self order... they are busy and the place is clean enough but they are under staffed.
4799,22,2 years ago,5 stars,Got a couple coffees they were great and they were delicious. Staff very courteous and my coffees came up quick. Felt very safe.
4800,22,3 months ago,1 star,Horrible and very rude guard
4801,22,a year ago,1 star,Very dirty dicusting.. food was sloppy and taste awful... wired and very unpleasant view of costumers in there...the most ugliest McDonald's I've ever been toï¿½ï¿½ï¿
4802,22,3 years ago,4 stars,"It's a big space, it's a bit allover the place when it comes to management and foot traffic, some go to this mcd's with the intention of hanging out. The service is a hit and miss, and at times the place can be a bit dirty, but the prices r decent for the area."
4803,22,a year ago,3 stars,"The service is ok,  and the food is responsible, not too expensive. I'm not a fast food eater, but I needed to eat something that I don't cook. It was ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"

4805,22,a year ago,1 star,Very crowded you will probably catch covid from the first 60 seconds of being in here you can't even walk in here too many people it seems like the kids get out of school and go here too and terrorize the place
4806,22,7 months ago,3 stars,Place was not clean and the staff not particularly gentle.
4807,22,4 years ago,3 stars,Quick and fast. They have kiosks thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s easy to use and place your order. The place looks m
4808,22,6 years ago,4 stars,If you are passing through and need a place to eat or you don't have time to put dinner on the table usually this is you're next option. But before going anywhere else to eat come here first. If you are looking for people who still care about there job in this day in age and are dedicated to making there service the best it can possibly be this is where you should go.
4809,22,4 years ago,1 star,Nasty. Gnats flying around the trash can. The trash bin was so full people started leaving trash by the drink station. Security talking on the phone. They need to pay attention to the dining area. I was highly dissatisfied
4810,22,a year ago,3 stars,"It's great but always double check your bag before you leave, this is the 3rd time already they've forgotten to put something in my order that I PAID for."
4811,22,a year ago,1 star,"I've loved the original McChicken since it was introduced in the 80's when I was a baby.
But getting that McChicken from midtown it was so bland and felt rushed.
I ate it of course but still it tasted bad compared to the original McChicken"
4812,22,2 years ago,3 stars,There fast only problem they area is surrounded by ppl who do drugs like heroin crack/cocaine k2 ect.... Not an area to bring ur kids or family too not even for tourist nothing to see there
4813,22,3 years ago,1 star,"Do not go after 9pm. The store was trashed and dirty and staff moved liked they'd just smoked a spliff. Very slow and had to repeat my order, which was on 2 cups of coffee!! Try to avoid this place like the plague."
4814,22,2 years ago,3 stars,So ehm what can I say? Italy is the best for the food of course and the chips are offended because you use the ketchup on them and I didn't ask for them. They are too much little soft and I bought them for too much. Paulino is the best! Anywayso I love the mec and bye
4815,22,5 years ago,2 stars,"For every good and helpful employee, there's a bad and rude one to accompany them. These employees seem to go out of their way to be as unhelpful and rude as possible. And they'll regularly give you sauce packets that are sticky, dirty, and half destroyed. It's honestly worth it to either go to the one in Penn Station or at 42nd street."
4816,22,4 years ago,1 star,"Because the female security guard that works for you is very very nasty and very unprofessional.  She throws 90% of the people out for no reason.  She has told the workers behind the counter not to take my order and not to serve me. She has not yet been able to give anyone a reason as to why she is putting me out. Majority of the people who come there. She has done the same thing to. She was once the warden at rikers island,  but she was  caught in the big drug ring letting  the other correction officers bring in the  drugs so now she is working  in McDonald's.  She has threatened  me  and has been harnessing myself and at least 50 other people.  I have called the police and  they told me to call McDonald's corporate  number. Something has to be done about her. She has no right treating people like this"
4817,22,11 months ago,5 stars,I love visiting McDonald's on my own or either with the kiddos  because that's their favorite place to eat...

But for me, she would do a favor by letting me t"
4819,22,3 weeks ago,1 star,Boy this placr was scary
4820,22,6 years ago,1 star,"It's unfortunate that this location is the closet to me. The staff really sucks here. From the lack of smiling, hospitality, and there's absolutely no thank you at the end of paying for your meal and no apologies when they give you the wrong order, they just hastily take the next customer. Even the cleaning crew sucks. I asked to be let into the bathroom and he looked at me with a blank expression. There is NO diversity what so ever. Only Spanish speaking crew members....... what a shame."
4821,22,7 years ago,1 star,"I wish I could give it a no star! My purse got robbed inside the store and I asked the manager if he can please show me for video evidence he approached me by saying No, ask those ladies raising his voice at me and walked away. How helpful was the manager..."
4822,22,3 years ago,2 stars,"This place is not very clean. When I first walked in, I heard yelling from a waitress saying ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½302, 302ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and there were many insects in this "
4823,22,a year ago,3 stars,"It's just like any other McDonald's. The only problem is is the homeless tend to coming in out of here a lot. And use the bathroom to bathe. But that doesn't affect the food and stuff too much. Like I said, it's just like any other McDonald's."
4824,22,2 years ago,3 stars,"The food is standard, but the customers are awful.  Not their fault. But if you like the homeless and drug addicts  watch you eat. This is the place to go."
4825,22,3 years ago,1 star,"This place in particular is a complete mess. And that day I went in was a Saturday afternoon, it was FULL of drug addicts and they took over the place, I believe there's a Rehabilitation Center near by and that's the reason. But however, I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, unless you order to take out."
4826,22,2 years ago,5 stars,"It's a nice place, clean and good service, besides they follow the pandemic rules, I'm don't like that kinda food, but my kid love it"

4828,22,5 years ago,1 star,"The meal was good but there were to many homeless people and beggars inside this McDonalds. The beggars where fairly aggressive, impertinent and well prepared for tourists. They wanted to push a brasilian woman next to my table to give them 20 $.  She wanted to give them 5 $, but they tried to argue with her for 15 minutes! It was more like threatening than arguing. I was so pissed of after this experience.... The food is great, but the management should take care about this situation and protect their guests, especially tourists."

The security guard was sitting down talking to a customer, I knocked on the door and realized there was no one inside. So I asked him to open the door. He told me that if I did not have attitude he could do it faster. Then he opened the door and said Black people always have attitudes. He proceeded to curse at. I went to talk to the manager who pretty much ignored me and continued cooking French fries. I called the corporate number. This was by far the worse experience I have ever had in a McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"

Walked in to the staff and security guard having a loud conversation or arguement im not sure, but after hearing the ""N"" word 20 times and standing there not being greeted i left. I felt unsafe and the staff were truly ghetto and extremely irresponsible. 0 work ethic 0 respect. If your a tourist avoid this location ! ! ! !"
4834,22,a year ago,3 stars,This specific location had an incredible amount of loitering drug addicts- homeless and Dirty ppl- DEFINITELY AVOID THIS ONE- ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC!!
4835,22,a year ago,5 stars,Quick to pickup when you don't have much time. The fountain drinks are the best!
4836,22,4 years ago,2 stars,"Hello, I  would have gave this McDonald's  a better review but.. They have a person or the store manager  on the floor  telling  people they have to sit and the back or leave.. these people are the homeless and IV drug users....FYI THEY PAYED FOR THEIR FOOD!!"

It's supposed to be fast food...nothing in this place is fast. Missed my train by 5min with me running to Penn the whole way from here. Garbage is the sum up for this location. If you're thinking about getting something quick before your travels, look elsewhere. You're better off going hungry than waiting for these lazy employees to do their job."

Where would you go without a home. The facilities are kept clean."
4842,22,3 years ago,1 star,This place had garbage on the tables and floors. It looked like a section 8 soup kitchen in there. Understaffed with unprofessional delinquents. they have their street friends coming from behind the counter after hanging out in the kitchen while tons of people were waiting for their food.
4843,22,4 years ago,3 stars,"Very cold atmosphere.
Cash registers unattended with customers waiting to place order.
Smile was lacking whilst interacting with customers.

4846,22,5 years ago,1 star,The security hear are a hassle.  You can't eat in peace.  I have a digestive problem and she is watching her clock. She's unprofessional and disrespectful to paying customers. She is pushing out.  You need to address her aproach.And how to handle the customers here.
4847,22,4 years ago,5 stars,Wonderfully managed McDonald's with very fast service...  I go here all the time and the staff is truly genuinely nice and friendly... the best coffee for a dollar I've ever had... and even better when somebody else brews it for you...
4848,22,3 years ago,1 star,"Ordered McNuggets through the electronic menu and they made me select sauces, but none were given in the order.  The nuggets were dry and overcooked, especially without any sauce.  They also took my receipt when I wanted to keep it, so overall a poor experience."
4849,22,5 years ago,2 stars,There was a constant beeping sound that none of the employees seem to care. The tables were greasy with fries everywhere. At least the food was made fast. But I still recommend using another McDonald's.
4850,22,4 years ago,1 star,One of the most disgusting places i have ever been too in the world. And i live in NYC!! In the early morning hours the place is full of herion addics doing drugs or just laying on their booths all high. They put my coffee in the microwave when i asked for it to be hot. Meaning it was probably from the night before.   I donot recommend this place unless you are a junkie.
4851,22,5 years ago,4 stars,"Often busy because of the high flow of traffic in the area, but as far as a McDonald's goes it is not bad. Service is quick, prices are good, food is consistent for the most part."
4852,22,5 years ago,1 star,"This one of the worst environments to eat and i aint too picky.. the place is nasty, and filled with a whole lot of people with drug problems. I felt a bit suspect when i walked in but still ordered, the staff is rude and ignorant,  got my order wrong. Bur i guess they go along with the crowd that comes in and treats everyone like that.. Be Warned not the best place ..and some Mcdonalds are ok.."
4853,22,4 years ago,3 stars,I arrive around 7am the place is packed with drug addicts.  However the service and food has been good and the older lady keeps the women's bathroom very clean.
4854,22,6 years ago,3 stars,"I too have experienced: people soliciting you for money (male Hispanic), homeless people,   and other apparent derelicts. ...Also a methadone clinic is nearby :-( This location needs security guards to keep out the unwanted customers"

4858,22,6 years ago,1 star,"Why read a review of a McDonalds? Because they're not all the same. The quality of food and customer service changes across stores.

Slow. Limited availability of basic soda. Employees spent 5 minutes watching an overflowing drinks machine, instead of serving customers.

Worst McDonald's in the area."
4859,22,5 years ago,1 star,"This McDonald's security is horrible. The Africa American lady talks down to people and rush you while your still within your 30 minute time limit. She calls the police every 10 minutes and her mouth is reckless towards paying customers. I've never been more horrified to go to McDonald's. Me & my friends eat there every day spending no less than $10 a piece. They just changed to this security company and they are very very nasty to paying cuatomers. She flashes her police badge to scare people away from here.
This woman is very unprofessional and something needs to be done before someone gets hurt. Thank you."
4860,22,5 years ago,1 star,"DISGUSTING !!! that's the only way I can describe this place. It's 1:30 am on a Saturday and my Lord not 1 but 7 people either sleeping in booths or begging for food or money, and the bath room doors don't even lock. Is this allowed to happen? Is this how we run businesses in NY.  I guess McDonalds cares about ALL of their customers, no matter how unsafe they feel.  They just want their money and can't get sued by someone less fortunate, for being kicked out even if they haven't ordered anything. Good job McD's."
4861,22,6 years ago,1 star,Two people got shot after an altercation at this McDonalds. I walked past this morning and two low life thugs were bashing each other up with blood spilling over their faces. Police had to restrain them. The cheap low quality food produced here attracts a horrible crowd. I wouldn't go here and I'm looking forward to this establishment shutting down.

Great service good taste
Thanks McDonaldï¿½ï"
4863,22,a year ago,4 stars,The foods pretty good. But you have to pay to use the restroom. But the foods awsome and the ice cream machine works
4864,22,2 years ago,3 stars,"It's not a good MD for family...It's clean, well lit and service great but people hang out with our food....or a 3 hour bag of fries.."
4865,22,6 years ago,3 stars,"Common fast food nothing more nothing less....homeless hangout right outside the restaurant and come in to ask you for ""change"" that's irritating when trying to get a bite. Management did however run them out of the store when caught ...unfortunately others came right in as soon as manager was behind the counter."
4866,22,a year ago,5 stars,"I go to McD because it's familiar. Even when I want to try something new, I start researching my options but in the end I can't make up my mind and I'm getting hungry so I default to McD."
4867,22,4 years ago,5 stars,Like there new 6 dollars menu. Affordable for those who can for now I no they r going to change it back after the holidays. But I wish they would keep it.for us low income people.
4868,22,3 years ago,1 star,"Omg whatever compelled me to come in here aside from the fastest and courteous service ever, it's frequented by the worst elements of society ever. Police or security needed here cause these methadonians and crack addicts are over the top not to mention least harassing patrons for money"
4869,22,2 years ago,1 star,"I went in was a monday afternoon, it was FULL of drug addicts and they took over the place, I believe there's a Rehabilitation Center near by and that's the reason. But however, I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, unless you order to take out."
4870,22,6 years ago,2 stars,"No free refills on drinks, much more expensive than other McDonald's. The restaurant itself is in a sorry state of disrepair. Broken seats, tables with names carved into them grease splattered on the walls begs many questions about what goes on here. Having recently eaten in other McDonald's all over the world, this one has probably been the worst."
4871,22,4 years ago,5 stars,"This mcdonald's is excelent to observe NYC's night people. All kind of things happened in a short lapse after 11PM. Kudos to the security guard, he did a great job, he was full handed though. Advice: avoid eye contact"
4872,22,3 years ago,5 stars,"Dnt let the long lines fool you, they move fast and efficiently.  The restaurant dining area is always clean, im not afraid to use their drink machine lol . All nyc McDonald's should follow suit lol"
4873,22,a year ago,4 stars,McDonalds spicy chicken sandwich and fillet o fish was delicious. Very clean and fast service.
4874,22,8 years ago,1 star,"This is the worst Mcdonald's I have ever been in. This place is the epitome of bad customer service. They charge extra for additional ketchup, do not offer free refills and a tiny portion of the dining room is open after 1 am. They close off most of the dining room. One time, I went in to order something around 1 am, but was unable to find any seating because other people were on their laptop hogging the booths and not ordering anything. They were taking up space. Mcdonalds staff did nothing about it when we complained about there being no seating. Most Mcdonalds offers free refills on medium and large drinks, but not this one. One time I asked the manager for a free refill and he was very rude and dismissive. This is not an ideal place to dine in at all, but it is still convenient to order a coffee there though."
4875,22,5 years ago,2 stars,"The employees can't tell the difference between Diet Coke and Coca-Cola, worst of all I asked them for a second drink and they still got it wrong!!  But they did do my Big Mac good so that why I give 2 stars"
4876,22,5 years ago,3 stars,This store is a great place to eat but the homeless people take advantage of the restaurant during business hours. it's much better now they have security to keep them under control.
4877,22,3 years ago,2 stars,Just another place trying to automate to our detriment. Ordered on machine - requested eat in - asked for a table ticket. (What the hell is a table ticket) mashed in a number. Received a to go order and my sandwich didn't have the lettuce / tomatoes removed as I requested. Can we go back to the days of just ordering at the counter from a human being?
4878,22,4 years ago,5 stars,The McDonald's was pretty organised. Better than some others in the US. A lot of room to sit at and clean toilets. The food was okay like you would expect from the McDonald's.
4879,22,4 years ago,4 stars,Love the new touch screen menus. Staff was friendly and efficient. Tables were so-so clean (had to wipe up my own).
4880,22,5 years ago,3 stars,Not the best hamburgers but they are very good for the price
4881,22,5 years ago,1 star,"This place is horrible! One of the employees allows drug addicts to use the restroom and hang out in the back. I stopped here because my aunt wanted to use the restroom. As soon as I took a look at the people hanging around, it was obvious."
4882,22,10 months ago,3 stars,Depends on who is working. Sometimes it's a incompetent mess to try to get your food
4883,22,2 years ago,3 stars,There's one thing I have to say why have a dollar menu when there isn't one. S.M.H went there last night just for a mcchicken and they wanted 3<<$ and some champagne   I really didn't have it  and was so disappointed.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
4884,22,4 years ago,3 stars,"Not bad but when you place orders on the web, they never put the kepchut, or ranch or anything like that, the other days they forgot to bring my sodas."
4885,22,4 years ago,1 star,Terrible location. Workers are slow and ghetto. Some donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t even wear a uniform. Random people come in and out the kitchen area an

4888,22,5 years ago,3 stars,"SAME AS MOST FAST FOOD JOINTS.
THEY HAVE ALLOWED HOOLIGANS TO SABOTAGE THE OUTLETS AND THEY HAVE ALSO NEGLECTED TO FIX THEM.THAT'S HOW I KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION.
THE PLACE IS PRETTY CLEAN.MOST OF THE STAFF IS FINE EXCEPT ONE GUY WHO REFUSED TO DO HIS JOB AND HELP OUT WITH THE APP FOR THE BUSINESS WHEN I HADDA PROBLEM WITH IT AFTER I ORDERED."
4889,22,6 years ago,4 stars,The best street food in the nyc.  I don't know what type of Charcoal the use. But the Taste is unique. I love this  street food so much.  That  I go to after I featen from a restaurant in the same neighborhood.  The season  they put on top of the chicken thigh is to die for.
4890,22,4 years ago,1 star,"Too crowded, not ""Too dirty"",but not clean enough for me to eat in,order a coffee & go,that's just me.
Oh yeah, I've seen prices lower in other McDonald's like the one on 8th.av. bet.24th. & 25th.st."
4891,22,3 years ago,1 star,Ordered for stay and followed the kiosk to use the table service. Waited for 15 mins and never delivered. Went to the pick up area and don't see my order number on the display.

4894,22,6 months ago,5 stars,"Very busy site, a clean as it could be,"
4895,22,4 years ago,1 star,I don't know what you did to your franchise but all I wanted was a cup of coffee and it took me half an hour.might have been better if your manager was there to help people and not on her phone
4896,22,5 years ago,3 stars,"This McDonalds is always an adventure. It is also slightly famous. Famous or infamous I don't know but there is a good NY Times article on it.  It is always crazy packed.  The line control is insane.

The food is normal McDonalds and haven't gotten sick from it which is good.

Basically if you're u come here just get ready to enter a jungle."
4897,22,a year ago,5 stars,It's a McDonald's. Get's 5 stars because my order was correct (egg McMuffin no cheese). Good job :)
4898,22,4 years ago,1 star,"This McDonald's is hit or miss, after you walk past the homeless and myth heads your food is nasty; bread is old or fries have no salt and not fresh. Outside smells like piss. Pick another McDonald's, caution."
4899,22,4 years ago,3 stars,Cashier was friendly and helpful. The workers moved quickly in serving the guests.  My grilled sandwich was tasty.
4900,22,5 months ago,5 stars,{In my Cardi B voice} OUCH

4910,22,4 years ago,5 stars,This restaurant is just near to my hotel Wingate. As usual we had a fish burger here. Service is good. Taste is okie. Mcdonald's fried is the best among fast food restaurant.
4911,22,6 years ago,3 stars,Air conditioning is very cold. Used to be a drug spot but now they post a policeman outside. They serve a lot of customers and they keep the place well-maintained.
4912,22,a year ago,1 star,Regular Macdonald's but it was forbidden to fine-in even though many restaurants are reopening their indoor spaces and it was also impossible to go to the restrooms.
4913,22,4 years ago,5 stars,Nice and clean and you dont wait a long time to get your food and have z credit card session if you don't want to wait on line and more faster as well
4914,22,2 years ago,2 stars,"missing part of kids meal, plus less of  following covid19 precussion- disorganized to that extent. gives opportunity of 10 strangers to gather on order or pick up session."

4916,22,3 years ago,5 stars,Went McDonald's in Manhattan. It was excellent. The food was hot and the service was good and fast. Note 33rd St McDonald's air conditioning was broken. No problems.
4917,22,5 months ago,2 stars,"Dirty place, slow service"
4918,22,6 years ago,1 star,"They charged a price to replace coffee with orange juice in the breakfast that's almost the price to just buy a separate juice, didn't notify me and gave me someone else's receipt when I asked for it. When I came back in 5 minutes to buy the $1.99 2-burritos, I only got one and she refused to give me the receipt."

4921,22,7 years ago,2 stars,We had breakfast here a couple of times. Always tons of homeless people around. One guys was dancing like crazy. Pretty entertaining ...
4922,22,5 years ago,1 star,I won't be visiting my local MacDonalds again after finding out about the awful conditions that their chickens endure. They are bread to grow so large that they are crippled under their own weight and live a life of pain and suffering. #ImNotLovinIt

4930,22,3 years ago,1 star,"Horrible service. They got my order wrong so many times, like i order a customize sandwich and they made it with things i said no to.smh the mc donalds is very humid like there is no working air condioning"

4941,22,3 years ago,2 stars,"No electrical outlets for customers in a fairly large restaurant. They also got my order wrong--I ordered an egg and cheese biscuit and got chicken, which at least is more expensive than what I ordered even if it wasn't what I wanted. Hash browns overpriced. They make it look like you get two on the kiosk graphic to trick you."
4942,22,4 years ago,1 star,Female patrons enter this McDonald's at your own risk. There is a female heroin addict hanging in the females bathroom trying to assault and Rob female patrons in the women's bathroom. I advise you to not go to that mcdonalds

5470,22,3 years ago,2 stars,Place smells security staff is a joke
5471,24,2 months ago,5 stars,Staff that is both courteous and knowledgeable.  Food always tastes fresh. I like that they have two ordering stations so that you can still enter and exit as quickly as feasible even during busy times. I always make sure to stop by and get at least a strawberry sundae whenever I'm in the neighborhood. It is worthwhile to visit the location to acquire a snack or meal.
5472,24,4 months ago,4 stars,Love McDonald's. Been eating them since the Super Size days. Finally they have fresh beef burgers. Would you eat it this pink?
5473,24,2 months ago,4 stars,"I never dine in but if I do eat here, it is through the drive thru. They always have great customer service which is really nice. The food sometimes is not so great. Either ingredients are missing (probably do to food outage) and sometimes my food is cold which is super undesirable. This place isn't bad, it could definitely improve."
5474,24,a month ago,4 stars,"Popular restaurant for people.
Location is convenient & parking is easy.
I use drive through most of the time.
Prices are a few cents than other locations in this area in some items (prices are varied with restaurant locations)."
5475,24,2 months ago,2 stars,"Sometimes the closing hours are not reliable! I cant tell you how many times I've had to cancel an uber eats order for delivery because somewhere the order was accepted but this place was closed! Disappointing to the customer who was looking forward to that late night/wee hours of the morning food and infuriating to me because that's MY TIME wasted and money not going into MY pocket! aka not getting paid for delivery!

On a personal note, I've had MANY upon MANY confrontations with the people who give me the food - I ONLY drink REGULAR dr pepper and as an avid soda drinker since elementary school (now 51) I know the difference between regular and diet - it seems like if you come here after a certain hour, even though I've asked for REGULAR DR PEPPER, I always seem to get one that tastes like a diet one! I have had them give me 3 dr peppers in one drive thru order just to end up with something that clearly was NOT a regular one!!! In addition to having the attitudes checked from those that gave me BIG ATTITUDE for being so, I guess ""insistent that this was not regular dr pepper, I would also examine the machines when they run low or tell the employees not to outright LIE about giving me regular dr pepper just to keep $1.40 - which btw, I'm curious as to why I was charged $1.41 for a large at this location when I'm ALWAYS charged $1.40 at the one on mathilda!!!????"
5476,24,2 months ago,4 stars,I like the fact it has longer hours then most of them. If only some of the employees that work drive thru were alittle more friendly. Instead of being short fused and somewhat rude.

5478,24,a year ago,5 stars,Best McDonald's I've ever been to.  Absolutely best double quarter pounder I've had at a fast food restaurant. I'm beyond impressed with the speed and quality I experienced here. I bit into my burger and thought I was anywhere other than McDonald's.  I was taken back by how great it tasted.
5479,24,11 months ago,2 stars,"Dining room closes at 7pm.  No self serve beverages.  Don't understand that at all.  The food is still good though, just have to put some ketchup on a Big Mac.  ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"

5481,24,5 months ago,5 stars,"Update (12-29-2022): I visited this location again around the same time and the food was hot and fresh. Ordered 60 chicken nuggets, 2 fries, 2 large drinks, and 10 apple pies. We had to wait 10 minutes for the pies which is understandable because they take awhile and they don't usually have that many of them just sitting around.

Went pretty late at night (close to 1 AM) and the fries were surprisingly hot and my Shamrock Shake wasn't melted. I did ordered using the app and had zero issues. It was an unusually pleasant McDonald's experience and I will be a repeat customer at this location."
5482,24,4 months ago,2 stars,"I don't know how you've been called in 24 When I came to 3:30 in the morning it was 3 people in there and they say was close, How does a place advertise 24hr drive thru and only take cash after midnight. I don't see how corporate agreed with this."
5483,24,a year ago,2 stars,Ended with a caramel frap all over my cup holder. My burgers had MC sauce all over it like they dipped it into the sauce. Just be careful I know is fast food but my car ended up super messy after my small meal.
5484,24,a month ago,2 stars,"This store is so disorganized, plenty of people working not all that busy yet took 27 minutes to get food. I'm sure this is not the mcDonalds model."

5487,24,6 months ago,2 stars,"Absolutely done with this location, I always seem to get the same woman at the drive-thru I don't know her name but I know her voice and she screws up every single time then when I try and correct her she gets mad and acts like it's my fault. I don't know if she's special needs or something or there's a learning disability or if she's hard of hearing I don't get it. And even lately when I hear it's her I actually make sure to enunciate clearly but it doesn't seem to help. The young man that I occasionally get is always on point he has never messed up an order. I'm guessing she is related to management or has incriminating photos or something. She has absolutely no people skills and I will not go back to this place"

How slow can they be!? I can see 4 workers in here but that still don't explain this wait! These workers' sense of urgency is not there at all... Not even moving with any purpose! Maybe that is JUST the ""night""... So I hope."
5491,24,2 weeks ago,1 star,Manager was rude. We asked simple questions about prices and deals and responded with no empathy.
5492,24,8 months ago,1 star,"Waited in the dine-in area for about 15 mins for someone to take my order, workers pass by me and saw me and didn't even acknowledge me. Managers also pass by me and didn't even bother to ask if I was helped. Restaurant has ordering machines but there not working so you have to wait for any of the many workers there to acknowledge your existence at the restaurant to make a purchase. Will not be returning to this restaurant ever, rather take my money else where."
5493,24,11 months ago,3 stars,"This McDonald's is open late, has two lines to order food through drive through. However, the speaker on the one I went to is a little low, and they got my order wrong. Luckily the staff member read back my order before I paid and I was able to correct it before I paid. Food was barely warm but well packed."

5496,24,9 months ago,1 star,"Customer service needs work at this location. I came in during my lunch time to get a simple McChicken and fries and a drink. Stood at the register for about 10 to 12 mins waiting for one of the many employees walking pass me to deliver the orders outside. Once they finally notice me, they took my order. After I waited around another 15 more mins to get my order. I was gonna ask for BBQ sauce but decided I didn't wanna wait an extra 5 mins for that. Overall, this restaurant only prioritize the drive-thru and not the dine-in area. Dine-in area has no cashier available because everyone is focus on drive-thru. So many workers on the front but none on cashier. If your coming here for lunch hour order online or else your lunch hour might turn into only 20 min lunch with all the waiting you'll be doing here."
5497,24,8 months ago,1 star,This one McDonald's I find charging $2 for a large coffee everywhere else it is $1 for any size drink and the reason I go to McDonald's at all is because of the coffee but if they're going to double the price of the coffee then I may as well go to any 7-Eleven so I have to save this one particular McDonald's would not lower the price when I told him that it was $1 everywhere else. Arguing with a customer is not a good idea it would have been a better idea if she would have said I'm going to let it go this time but no they actually try to argue the point and I think that's silly the whole reason that I come there at all is because of the $1 coffee that is fairly good on a one to 10 scale I would say McDonald's coffee is it seven or eight with Starbucks being a 10 especially when they suggest you get the expresso shot that is $4.25 for the large coffee with the extra espresso shot from Starbucks and then there's creamer but that for dollar coffee is four times better than McDonald's one dollar coffee so you get what you pay for I just think McDonald's at that particular Stevens Creek location bites off customers
5498,24,9 months ago,3 stars,"Late night service is mixed; they reset their registers at arbitrary times and they either are cash only or close the drive thru completely during this time. There seems to be no schedule, just depends on when they think it'll be slow it seems. Those inconsistencies aside, the food and service is typical McDonalds."

5504,24,a year ago,3 stars,"Items were frequently missed out, but  I get it, these people are slammed with orders, so you can't expect the orders to be 100% accurate everytime. But today, my little one got so mad when she found out her drink and apple slices from her HappyMeal were missing. I mean come on, you order a Happy meal and only get a burger with nothing to drink? (Well at least you managed to put a toy in so thank you for that) Not great! AND we were the only ones in line at that time, so they were not that busy I guess."

NEVER will I return to it after being treated like a pariah. I was yelled at by the cashier who took the wrong order; and the branch manager threw a box of fries in the bag mumbling as if I was a beggar. In her condescending tone, the latter even warned me that she was doing me favor even though they made a mistake with my order and I did pay full price for it. I think they both need more trainings to acquire the best of American customer service."
5507,24,a year ago,4 stars,"I would have given 5 stars but, the lady (MNGR) that took my order got one item wrong & I did not notice until I was long gone! Also, the COVID headache is pretty much behind us but, for some odd reason this location still has a limited/restricted dining room, even to the point of closing it down completely at 3:00pm everyday! I can understand being cautious & prepared but, to use the pandemic as a way to justify limiting/restricting areas of an establishment  that we as patrons normally use on any normal/regular day is unprofessional, inconvenient & just a way for them to make it easier to keep clean & one less thing to be done when it comes to closing down for the night!
However, though this ranting & raving I am doing in this post, I still get good customer service there when I do go for a quick & easy meal! & Their drive thru is  conveniently open 24 hrours"

5511,24,a year ago,3 stars,"The food was great with the exception of the fries. They were stale and I would have gone back around and had them replaced, but the guy at the drive-thru window was annoyingly slow and the rest of the food would have been borked. The hamburger made up for it though, did you see the greasy heart attack waiting to happen?

Just an FYI, mobile ordering saved absolutely zero time at this location. We still had to go to the drive-thru and wait and they didn't have anything ready so unless you just like ordering from an app, don't bother.

I would still recommend eating here. YMMV on the staff at any fast food restaurant. Sure this guy was somewhat annoying by being slow but he wasn't intentionally being a jerk or anything."

They were a the on the slow site, but we just figured it was all the people coming back to get their straws. other than that it was just your regular McDonald's experience. very grateful it was open though. since covid you don't find to many 24 hrs. locations that still actually stay open all night as hours state. That in itself is a whole different issue and honestly very difficult to figure out without driving down an unlit window on a drive-thru with a sign stating ""we're open 24 Hours..""

Also took items  and was charged for adding lettuce."

The guy on cashier was fast and efficient. I don't need to be treated like I'm spending $1000 so the efficient process works for me. Food was as expected for any McD's..if you have little time and crave the golden arches, this location will have you on your way soon enough."

Including a time when we were complaining to the manager about constant errors and she was adamant that her team doesn't get orders wrong, they handed us the wrong order. Nothing wrong with the food but the staff needs better training."
5529,24,2 years ago,4 stars,So much improvement. They're serving good fries now - newly cooked (vs. saggy and felt like microwave warmed before). Curbside pick up was so helpful. We'll comeback!
5530,24,2 years ago,2 stars,Friendly staff but fries were stale!  They even took some time to put together my order giving me the appearance that a fresh batch of fries were coming out of the fryer.  I was wrong-they tasted like they were scraped off the floor.  Was here around 9pm last night.
5531,24,a year ago,3 stars,The food and service was good but kind of disappointed as this is the 1st McDonald's I've been to in the south Bay that has completely closed off the bathrooms and customer areas.  I'm sure it's due to pandemic but strange other McDonald's at least have restrooms open for guests
5532,24,a year ago,3 stars,They just be throwing my daughter Happy meal meal in the box I'm not sure if it's me or if it's the people that's working at McDonald's but yeah my daughter is tired of her Happy meal just been thrown in a box it's not a Happy meal it's a throne in a box meal kind of sort of and if you want fresh fries and fresh nuggets you have to ask and it's been several times where I've ordered something and something's missing so I have to make sure you looking your things before you drive completely off from this
5533,24,a year ago,3 stars,This McD has the best prices along Lawrence Expressway. Drive-thru can take up to 20 minutes during peak times. I couldn't get a breakfast deal in the app to complete in time due to the long drive-thru wait. The app wouldn't allow curbside or in-store pickup 10 minutes before breakfast deadline.

Food tastes fresh all the time. i like the fact that they have 2 ordering stations so when its busy you can still get in and out as quickly as possible. every time im in the area i make sure to stop by and get at least a strawberry sundae. the place is worth stopping by to grab a snack/meal.

Chances are we may not get the chance to visit when they are actually open, so heed my warning: THIS PLACE IS NOT 24 HOURS!!

Edit: After visiting that night, we tried again a little before midnight and the drive thru was still closed and blocked, and the sign still said open 24 hours."

5551,24,2 years ago,1 star,There is a horribly rude worker here.  I asked to order something and she just gave rude and sarcastic responses the entire time.  I confronted her about it at the window and she didn't seem to care.  Talked to the manager.  He said he would handle it.  Im sure he won't so I contacted corporate and gave my report.  Don't eat here.  They do not care about customer service.
5552,24,3 years ago,1 star,Slow service. No Ice at Breakfast.  Coffee tasted like cleaning solution was not rinsed out.  Hilariously a McDonald's employee was walking around the corner with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on a plate to eat for their own breakfast. Why no US flag?
5553,24,4 years ago,1 star,"Shity customer service, incompetent cashier took over 15 mins to place a single man's dinner order (it was only a big Mac, fries and a drink).  Parking lot was full (extremely small for the volume of customers). Drive thru line was super long and extremely slow.  After I finally got to the window after I paid I had to wait there for 10mins just to be told to pull around and park.  Had to wait another 15-20mins to get my order."
5554,24,5 years ago,1 star,"Not rated one star for this McDonald's, they actually happen to be a solid and enthusiastic group of people always willing to ensure your happiness and satisfaction. I just think McDonald's sucks in general. That being said, the staff at this specific restaurant is quite friendly and approachable, and I've never had a bad experience with the food or anything. They're usually quick and the food tends to be accurately prepared. In a world where this distinction mattered, I'd actually call this a really ""good"" McDonald's, but the significant other is bummed about their removal of garlic fries, and the ice cream machine is hellof broken all the time. Anyway. Bring vegan items to McDonald's."
5555,24,6 years ago,5 stars,"I come here a lot because I live close by. The staff are really nice people --friendly and open to talk with customers when it's not rush hour. Sometimes I stay here for an hour or two. I watch people come and go. Sometimes it's packed, sometimes it's only me with my family and 1 other person. There are a lot of seats, and there are high chairs for kids. Sucks that they cut out the power outlet a while back though. I must come with fully charged device or a power bank. \(>~<)/"

I went back thru the drive through 2 more times once at 445 and once at 454 and was informed again that i had to wait until 5 exactly. Then when i finally got to order thwy also screwed me on a hash brown. They werent polite about anything and made me feel very unwelcomed.
5558,24,5 years ago,3 stars,"This McDonalds is hit or miss depending on the staff. Its quick most of the time due to the dual drive through order stations, but that can also work against them and can slow down you getting your food at times to if you get out of order.
They seem to have  great breakfast team, but the dinner team is hit or miss. One day its great and the next time your order is all jacked up. They are normally pretty good with the normal menu items,  its the specialty stuff they jack up, like a Big Mac is Good here but a Grand Mac won't be because they leave off half the sauce or something silly, 5 lbs of lettuce, you get what I mean. Inside tends to be better then drive-through if you have the time."
5559,24,3 years ago,3 stars,"Food tastes like any other Mc Donald's. There was a short wait. They were out of Diet Coke in both soda fountains. They were also low on ice for the drinks. The dining area needed to be cleaned of all the trash by the soda fountains, tables, and floors.  They were also out of ketchup in the ketchup area by the soda fountains."
5560,24,3 years ago,1 star,I park into the parking lot I see 2 vans full of homeless people's junk. I walked in the MacDonald's bathroom one of the stalls was full of poop. Later I got my food . Was in my car ready to leave then I smelled poop   on my hands. The entrance door had poop from the person's hand. But on the bright side they gave me an extra meal for free. But the cleaning service was not good.
5561,24,3 years ago,1 star,The staff was rude and needs training on their people skills. There was no good morning greeting and when asking about menu options it was like talking to a brick wall. The service was also very slow even though it was not busy.
5562,24,4 years ago,2 stars,"We enjoyed the food. But not the service, only for the fact we waiting over 20min and this was 8:30pm. My grandson was waiting on his aunt so she can walk with him and his mom &dad for there night walk. He has preschool in the morning.  And he has to be asleep by 9 and in bed by 8:30. So as for this gramas point of view. An apologiey for the wait or here's a free of anything would have been taken in to consideration would have been excepted.  But no nothing from any employee just didn't make me feel McDonald's employee's did there job."
5563,24,2 years ago,2 stars,"Constantly getting the order wrong on several occasions, poor attitude at pick up... Worked fast food when I was a kid... So easy to do it right and smile to the customer! Unfortunately their manager was the one at pick up!"
5564,24,5 years ago,3 stars,"This McDonald's gets a 3 rating due to their lack of attention to drive thru orders.  Numerous times we get home after a visit to McDonald's and notice the forgot to include apple slices, or apple juice.  I agree these are smaller items and do not effect the price much, however, when you have kids waiting for their orders get very upset and get angry n hurt that these things are missing.  It is very upsetting!  Also, we tend to order a lot of unsweetened ice teas.  8 out of 10 times the tea tastes disgusting!!  It is old tea or the bag doesn't get changed when the make more.  I get so mad that no one seems to care enough to be sure every shift cares to do their job correctly to ensure a high quality in ALL their products.  I have brought these concerns to numerous managers and employees but never get satisfaction that they care and fix the issue!!  It may be ok for a week but happens again or on a different shift.  All emplyees should care enough about their jobs and themselves to do the best they can in all areas of a job performance!!!  Please do your best to inform this McDonald's of these issues and have them retrain and fix these issues.  My sanity and their job performances depend on this!!!  Thank You!!"
5565,24,5 years ago,2 stars,"Took 10 minutes to order food while standing at the counter due to employees just chatting and ignoring me, in plain virw. Ordered a side salad and a yogurt parfait, bother were less then half filled. Overall not good, but eventually got service"
5566,24,5 years ago,2 stars,Waited ~13 minutes for a simple hot fudge sundae (seems like my order was not placed on their electronic queue). Also pretty understaffed - cashier also dropping fries into fryer and running around doing other tasks.
5567,24,2 years ago,5 stars,I like McDonald's McChicken sandwiches and their Sundaes its delicious! I also like the way how they packaged their food Delivery its sealed with a security tape both drinks and food inside a secured paper bag with handles !! Best Fast food well safely secured in these challenging times when Coronavirus is ravaging our population and its health !! All fast food chains should follow McDonald's safety packaging procedures for food packaging deliveries !!
5568,24,3 years ago,1 star,"They removed tellers add kiosk which slows down the service. 10 minutes to get a Mcflurry and two cookies..... Mcflurry is small is tiny, cookies are as well. Kitchen floor was dirty. Kitchen crew was understaffed. It won't be sad to see McDonald's decline, I won't be going back to any of them. Rarely ever do won't be hard to put a nail in the coffin."
5569,24,2 years ago,1 star,"There is something about the drink here...  One time I ordered Ice Tea and it tasted weird..  I let go of that one time..  And yesterday, I ordered the combo with Coke..  I ate and drank,  the next moment, I had like an ""diarrhea"" like symptom...  The coke tasted weird too..  I never had a problem like this when I ordered from other Mcdonald..  Last time the Ice Tea tasted bad so I tossed it away..  I only took a sipped that's why I didn't get a diarrhea like symptoms..  But this time I was so thirsty so I consumed half of the drink."

I Do not like their drive thru parking either. They should've moved it somewhere else. I went during lunch and they parked every single car and then had only one employee walking out the food. Hmm bad system."

5575,24,5 years ago,2 stars,"food is ok, just regular McDonald, but the drive thru is insanely back late night. 30+ mins wait time while there are just 3 customers, like how is this acceptable? Soda machine, ice cream machine, or the cashier constantly broke down. After 35 mins when I finally able to get my food, they told me no credit card, like what ? why don't you tell me 35 mins ago? just left right away."
5576,24,3 years ago,1 star,Drive thru was blocked at 1230pm. Had to make a 3 point turn to get out. Not sure why block it when there are cars (placed orders and waiting). Location is a nightmare since under renovation. Parking lot is taken by reno vehicles. Nearby has awkward design...
5577,24,3 years ago,1 star,Very disappointed in McDonald's in today's world. To me McDonald's has really gone downhill is service is the pits. Any employees most of all can use a lot more training I know I used to be the head manager at 556 East El Camino McDonald's and I'm appalled of what it turn into. I know when I was head manager there we always have a store I can just imagine what it is today.
5578,24,2 years ago,1 star,ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with cheese  no pickles. came in some aluminum bag all soggy nasty nsaty nsaty.  never again going there. should have gotten 0 stars
5579,24,4 years ago,3 stars,"Place is usually not busy but service can be slow, they seem to be understaffed.  Staff The place has really odd seating layout inside but they have seating outside in the shade.  Drive through is usually empty also.  They have assigned mobile order parking."
5580,24,2 years ago,4 stars,"- Usually fast service
- Mostly friendly customer service; some people could be more kind
- Quarter pounders always fresh
- Ice cream works 100% times I've ordered"
5581,24,5 years ago,1 star,"2 people working, 1 learning how to work, and two cleaning, instead of helping the line of drive thru cars and 8 people waiting inside to place their order. Took a half hour to get two cheese burgers, two fries, and two drinks at 10:30 at night. And that was only half of what we ordered, so we left."
5582,24,4 years ago,1 star,Went through the drive through and failed to check my order before getting on the road. Twice before I have been given the wrong order. How do they do that? Third time's a charm. I am pledging not to go to McD's again.

This is a busy location 9 times out of 10 there is lines and being a 24hr location they're ice cream machine seems to always be out of order hahah go figure... I feel as if the food has become extremely salty at all McDonald's locations over the years not very good. Found myself not finishing the food I had ordered And still hungry. Go some where better.. If youve read this far, you deserve it."
5586,24,4 years ago,4 stars,"The two McFlurrys that my party ordered seemed to not be whipped, which was unfortunate. Otherwise, the food was prepared quickly, even though we went during the lunch rush. Parking nearby could be full during lunch."
5587,24,6 years ago,1 star,"Probably one of the worst experiences I have had with McD's. 8 to 10 food alarms going off the whole time. The manager was outside smoking, leaving the staff to drown. The girl behind the counter spent more time apologizing to the same people over and over rather then work. Took about 20 mins to get two dollar menu cheeseburgers. Experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Probably won't give a second chance even."
5588,24,7 years ago,1 star,I paid 1 hotcakes and 1 hash brown by drive through behind me couple cars lined up and I waited 5+ min to pick my food last time same order they missed hash brown so i was about to check the items but behind people waiting so I moved my car near by signal I checked hash brown missing again this time I want them to know so I turn and reach same drive through I explained one of the women staff came and ask my bag and she inspect I was not feel good at this point later she ask a male staff and discussing something and looking me like I'm lying ...Bullshit.... who train the business ethics and code of cundect what the #@$%
5589,24,a year ago,1 star,"Disgusting . And they legit took forever to release my order. My mcchicken was made wrong and they had to re make it. All in all, it took about 10 minutes for 3 items of the value menu, never coming here again. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"
5590,24,2 years ago,1 star,I waited a whole hour just for chicken nuggets after i ordered and i didnt even get the sauce for the nuggets. then i had to pay with cash and no one wore gloves or a facial mask.

5592,24,4 years ago,4 stars,The only thin I can say is they need to stay up to date with the Happy Meal toys they Advertise. My kid comes in super excited to see the stand box with the Advertised toys to somet8being told the doth Have those at this time
5593,24,a year ago,4 stars,Fast but the line always long and sometimes it take so long for one customer. Curbside pickup take longer than drive thru.
5594,24,8 months ago,2 stars,"Against the background of other burgers, McDonald's is blown away, it's a pity that some of the first guys are now lagging behind."
5595,24,6 years ago,1 star,"I go here a couple of times a day if they are on a roll of making good tasting unsweetened ice tea. Ocassionally I get a snack. They have on their menu pricing for pies. .69 each or 2 for 1.00. When I read pies, I think it is all their pies. Nope. Their ""specialty"" pies are more and when you call them out on it they are rude and don't care. Like the customer is supposed to be able to mind read, pies means only apple pie. It was annoying to be treated so rudely over cold mcd pies. If you leadership is so unhappy maybe they should go somewhere that is a happier place. We all have choices.

There is some good leadership at this store and bad. There is no in between. Take your chances. I mainly go there for the tea....when it's good."
5596,24,7 years ago,1 star,"Twice in 6 months I thought I would get ice cream through the drive through. Both times they had no ice cream or yogurt. No sign, stick in long drive through to pick up nothing, not coming back again."
5597,24,4 years ago,3 stars,Versus others in the area this place always has trash bins full and rarely tiloilet paper. No changing tables in mens room. Dirty bathroom. Food consistant with others. Very busy but still could be clean.

5601,24,5 years ago,2 stars,If you find yourself scratching your ears while inside it might be due to very small bugs that most people can't see or don't think the bugs are bothering their ear. My vision? Better than 20/20 both near and far. Thanks

5604,24,6 years ago,4 stars,"It's not a junk foods place anymore. They start having healthy menu and I think it's great with the price. You can pick your own bread, type of meat and vegetable. End the menu with Sundae ice cream."
5605,24,3 years ago,3 stars,"I am not sure if anyone in the USA would read reviews about McDonald's but here it is anyways.

They are mediocre even by fast food standard. Unless you are really hungry or thirsty always try to avoid it."
5606,24,3 years ago,1 star,"They spending millions to renovate all their stores to stay pertinate,while selling smaller portions of their fattining foods and raising their prices to pay for making the place look modern,anybody else notice that McDonald's has gotten way more expensive,taken alot of stuff away from what used to be the dollar menu,and took away alot of the all day breakfast"
5607,24,4 years ago,3 stars,Typical McD's but did look a bit more modernized.  The lady taking orders was nice. Plenty of parking and drive thru line was organized. Good amt of mobile order parking as well.
5608,24,8 months ago,5 stars,Open late actually 10/10 quality of life improvement moving here
5609,24,7 years ago,1 star,went there on new years eve around 2 am ..crowded very much and the queue was not moving for the next 30 minutes. they did not had enough staff. left with hunger stomach. They should have atleast informed us that there is going to be a waiting time . 4 ppl before us and the queue never moved for 30 minutes was surprising.
5610,24,9 years ago,1 star,"Ordered a number 15 (chicken nugget) meal for $6.50. They somehow didn't get the fries part and only thought I ordered nuggets and drink (wtf?), even though I had made it very clear that I ordered the meal. Then they tried to charge me an ADDITIONAL $1 for the fries which would have put the total cost OVER the actual price of the meal. I wasn't having any of that bullsh*t and I guess they realized how ridiculous they were being, because they relented pretty quickly and handed over the fries."
5611,24,4 years ago,4 stars,Good ol micky D's same thing as usual nothing really changes but one thing this I've been going to this location for quite a while every morning order same thing a LARGE ICE HAZELNUT and a MED REG COFFEE  with a few fixings added most of the employees know me on a HELLO basis same for two MANAGERS there they see ME in line they make eye contact with me I shake my head get to the counter Cashier ask me the USUAL SUR i say yes and BLAM there's my two morning favorites so i go every day just to see great EMPLOYEES of this location ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï
5612,24,5 years ago,1 star,It was great the view was from where i sat was the  entrance door. From where she sat was the soda machine. In the middle was the order line. We sat at a table that was designed for people in the order line waiting to order  to look back some look straifht on and see you eating. Why? So they can get humgrier? They already hungry. Its probably because if your a kid eating a happy meal and they have toy there gonna want one too so you tell your parents you want one too. Or I whatever there eating they want to eat too because they are too lazy to look at the menu. Thats too much work. So the put a table for people to view where are eating. It menu ideas and advertisement.
5613,24,5 years ago,1 star,They had everyone wait in an extremely long line at the drive thru just to tell us it was cash only. Which should absolutely not be a thing at a McDonalds. We then had to continue waiting in line since there was no way out.
5614,24,2 months ago,1 star,"Pathetic customer service, never attends customer queries over phone. It says its open24 hours, but in multiple occasions cancelled the orders placed via delivery apps citing that the restaurant is not accepting orders."
5615,24,9 years ago,2 stars,Lady placing the orders is super nice. The crew making the food complete morons. Mixwd up order and put wrong condiments on wrong one. Its like they just tossed it together. Not tomention there is no way it'll pass wights and measurmentz. I expect competence.  Which is clearly lacking here.
5616,24,7 years ago,1 star,"Be a Careful with this Store
He charged me $1.39 + tax for a coffee. I remained him about McDonald's coffee price ($1.09+tax). But he said no & I back to my car, took more money then paid. (Store no. 4324, receipt 300, date feb.22/16 mon. 20:25)"

5618,24,7 years ago,4 stars,It opens 24/7 and it's very close to where I live. I usually order from drive through. They put sugar in my coffee when I ordered black coffee. This was their only mistake I have experienced.

5620,24,4 years ago,4 stars,"It's fast, it's food, it's cheap. It could be better, it could be faster, it could be cheaper, but it's familiar food, and it's never terrible food, sometimes it is even good food. So if you need reasonable quality food quickly and cheaply McDonald's is your place."
5621,24,3 years ago,3 stars,"Standard McDonalds.
But what was going on with the restrooms? Only two available and one is permanently closed. The other one is a favorite place for the homeless people in ten area as it seems. Two of them spend there 30+ mins. No chance to get in."

5640,24,6 years ago,4 stars,The drive through at this location is typically fast. Parking to dine in can be difficult due to drive through lines. Better than the average MacDonald's.

Will definitely recommend it.
And also it's open 24 hours which is even better and also it has drive through.
I will be coming often every week."

6215,6,a week ago,1 star,"A friend and I placed two separate mobile orders for drive through and theses two female employees are refusing to give us our orders because it didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t go through supposedly so we show them a receipt. They gave my friend his food, but they were refusing to give him his drink and my food. These to employees gave us a hard time calling us names in Spanish which we could understand what they said. We go to this McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s quite often and never had a problem until today they insult us and being rude for their mistake and not paying attention thankfull"
6216,6,3 months ago,1 star,Pulled up to the drive through. Never got anyone to take my order. Car pulls into other com spot instantly get order taken. I wait some more a second and third car goes through the order. I sat there 3 or 4 minutes and 3 cars on the other side before I pulled away. Never had this problem at this before and I go here once a week bc I work down the road. But I will not return because it's nonsense. The car before me in that lane got there order through no problem.
6217,6,3 months ago,4 stars,Did drive through because of time of day (5:30am). Got the Sausage Egg McMuffin with decaf coffee. Window drive through ladies were very pleasant and polite...even brewed fresh decaf for us!! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï
6218,6,3 months ago,1 star,"There ""service"" today was terrible. The menu displayed was not even available so when ordering from it you were told to order something else they never came to the window to collect the money after waiting in line for 10 minutes at window one simply to pay for my order I ended up driving away. If your not staff for a 24 hour business close at night."

Lady was so sarcastic and rude.
Not to mention she looked super unprofessional.
Super rude service at speaker and worse at the window.
She realized I was upset over the terrible service and has the audacity to say ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½you having a bad day?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

I ask for the price because she never told me it and she sucked her teeth rolled and her eyes at me and told me it.
And then charged me.

She was giving me this nasty death stare like Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ l cause I used to work for McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s.

6222,6,4 years ago,1 star,"Terrible! Ordered an artisan grilled chicken sandwich and this is what I got. Old soggy lettuce. So that tells me the person preparing the sandwich just didnt care or that this restaurant does not care about keeping fresh items in their kitchen. $8 for this meal to get home just to throw out this sorry excuse for a sandwich. And this was after I had to go BACK through the drive through a second time because my son's happy meal was missing the fries. I mean isn't there a screen that shows what should go in the bags before handing to the customer? And after the second time through I got home to that trash sandwich and they also forgot the sauce for the nuggets, even through I saw it on my receipt so they knew I wanted it, and hot cakes without butter. Just carelessness on all fronts at this location. Oh and when I got to the pick-up window I told the woman I have a boy so please put a boy toy in the happy meal, and she said all of our toys are unisex. I will include a picture of his ""unisex"" toy. Take the time and drive pass to the next McDonalds along your route."

Sometimes it's great and no issues and sometimes food is a little colder than you'd hope for or missing items from orders and such. I'd say we have more good experiences than ""bad"" and 4 stars is fair."

He repeated that he made them and if I wanted fresh fries I would have to pull over. I stated I have been waiting 45 minutes Ill wait right here. So he slammed the window shut and called the police. I moved
the car and 30 minutes later Im still waiting, no police have come so I asked for a refund. He refused to refund me and started cursina like crazv."

6256,6,8 months ago,2 stars,"When this restaurant switched from Corporate to Franchise a few years ago, I was really happy with the changes that were made, the owner was seen there frequently, the employees seemed happy to be working there and everything was running smoothly. Now in 2022 the lines are terrible, when taking your order they give you the total without asking if more items were needed, seldomly the employees smile at you, and you see that the employees are bothered by the customers. I stopped visiting as often as I did because the service went downhill. Today I visited only because a friend wanted some food for her son. Unless serious changes are made I don't plan to visit again."

Once called to complain and their response was ""just don't eat at this McDonald's"". What a joke, this place should be shut down

Edit: almost forgot to mention the one time they didn't even cook a patty all the way through. Was still pink in the middle. Like, you have one job when you're grilling burgers."

Service is slow, on Friday evening or night plan to spend 20 to 30 mins in the drive-thru, and you better check your order before you leave. Multiple times items have been missing from my order and just last week I only got 10 of my 20 pieces for the 20 piece nugget I ordered.

If this is what we can look forward to as minimum wage continues to climb I won't be getting this for my kids much in the future and will just make chicken nuggets and fries at home..."

Items missing in my order even after I asked if it was placed in the bag, Rude staff, very unprofessional, laughing/ joking with other employees while on the headset taking my order. Business number that appears online is disconnected, so you can't reach any management. Not even thru the survey online you can get anyone from corporate. Definitely I rather microwave a dollar burrito than come back here."

The drive thru person that was taking my order was the MANAGER TATIANA she was rushing me throughout my whole order and even said OH MY GOD because she was getting aggravated. The one person that has to set the example of customer service should be fired. I've never had a manager to any establishment talk to me in that way. And to top everything off the nuggets to all my orders were so sheet and not crunchy, like they sat on the warmer for hours because the employees were too lazy to fry up new ones. This McDonald's has gone so downhill. First it was the employees now it's management. They need a whole new crew"

Food was delivered within a few minutes but after waiting 10 minutes we had to go back into the drive through. Because they forgot our drinks. After we went back they gave it and when we went home they forgot to give us straws and the extra hashbrown we ordered. Food good but lacking service. Very nice cashier lady but the food handler wasnt as nice.

I said can you give me a minute please,  she replied under her breath ""that's all you had to say in the first place "" then when I went around to pay, she disappeared and had someone else accept my payment.  Then I was handed  my food  with stares and nothing Said by the staff. Needless to say,  I threw away the food. Not about to play games with these little high school kids.  A company who cares about their reputation should try to train and manage their workers before hiring them.  Horrible service tonight."
6280,6,a year ago,1 star,How hard is it to give people the right order?? The drive thru chick with the braces was too busy gossiping with her friend to give me the correct order on 09/25/21 at 9:15-9:30am. Stop gossiping in Spanish and work. $15 an hour where??? Hell No

Order just 2 sausage McMuffin with egg when I got it the bread was so hard at then ends it gum as I bit it I took both back after I got the fresh sandwiches I left I had to again return cause those new sandwiches had no eggs I wasted 26 min of my UBER/LYFT time even had to cancel ride .

These managers there needs to be on point and consistent with there employee and monitor a little more the food that goes out the store already cooked."

First, girl at the window messed up my order, then she gave me only 1 straw for an order of 2 drinks. To add worse on my list of service, she waved my drink up and down at me like i'm a dog.

Thank you, i won't be back anytime soon."
6284,6,2 years ago,2 stars,They used to be great but now the new managers are not trying to make customers happy. I asked for fries during breakfast and was told no the new store manager said they can't comply. I even told them I would wait. The other staff here are great and friendly.

I get my meal and asked about my cup of water the staff member seemed to not car and walked away. I walked in to ask for a water cup to have the rest of the staff say that if I wanted a water cup with a lid in a small cup, I would have to be in drive through... Where I came from... It wasn't until a shift manager 3 associates later did they ok for me to have a child cup of water.... Water."
6293,6,a year ago,3 stars,"This location will park you for 15 minutes when you've only ordered 2 items. This forces me to order for pick up most times so I don't have to wait 15+ minutes. Otherwise, food is okay."

We asked for a remake and was told that's how they are made. After we pushed for a remake the ""redone"" was still pink. The manager sarcastically asked for extra extra extra well done burgers, at which I noticed the cooking staff laughing and one was wiping their nose and face with their arms. After I immediately cancelled my order and asked for a refund. The night staff compared to the day staff is just like that; night and day. If I could give no stars I would."

6299,6,3 years ago,1 star,"Worst McDonald's experience ever.  Do not visit this location. It doesn't matter how many times you ask for a special request with your food, they will still make it wrong and than lie to you when they give it to confirming your request was done, when in fact it was wrong the whole time.  They will not give you your complete order the first time, you have to drive around and wait inline again or go inside to get your order correct, and if you don't double check it at the counter, they may get it wrong again. I do not recommend this location to anyone. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"

6310,6,2 years ago,1 star,I was discriminated by a drive Thru today for me being hard of hearing . Employees at this McDonald's are always extremely rude. They should be thankful in hard times like now they have jobs. Went thru drive thru w my kids was placing my order and cashier told me she would not take my order cause I was not fast she also said things that were rude and inappropriate.
6311,6,3 years ago,2 stars,The McDouble is terrible. Very dry and very little ketchup and mustard on it. Couldn't finish my first one. Bread should taste soft and fresh. Meat should be juicy. And they through it together which makes a mess. And hardly any onions on it. Fries should be soft not hard and with plenty of salt on them. ALL burgers should be juicy. That's what makes a great burger.
6312,6,a year ago,5 stars,"This McDonald's is super fast on ordering, prep, and moving  cars thru the drive thru. Awesome in having the order prepared and correct."
6313,6,6 years ago,1 star,"We were in the DRIVE THROUGH  for 30 MINUTES.  They messed up a simple happy meal order. I went inside to speak to the manager and told him that the fries were ice cold and they never gave me the drink that comes with it.  The manager never apologized he just looked at me and said ""ok"". He gave me the drink and new fries.  The employee was the one that had to apologize for him because he didn't hear an apology from the manager either, so after a pause of the manager just staring at me the employee said I apologize. Unbelievable, how the training for these managers are at this store."

Was my order right? No.
Will I ever go back? No.

I always park and go inside and order. I ordered on the kiosk and a lady (manager, perhaps) acknowledged me and in 4 minutes, I got my food whereas the drive through would've cost me at least 10 minutes.
Clean, fast and friendly service!"

Cold fries."

The guy at the window with painted nails was listening to music on his phone with both earbuds in and didnt say a word to me, I ordered pancakes with sausage and a medium coffee. They gave me a small coffee and kept saying that's what a medium is now, and it wasnt even drinkable. I know this is my fault for not checking especially after that, there was no butter, syrup, napkins, or utensils in the bag for the pancakes and sausage. Never coming here again"

I agreed. the associate who gave my food away came up to apologize and offered me cookies? as a forgiveness? i informed him i just wanted my food so i could go. 10 more minutes in the restaurant and i was out the door.

6337,6,5 years ago,1 star,"This is the most fickle drive through.  Some days they are on point and it's in and out.  Days like today, they have you pull forward to wait for your food. Eleven minutes later you walk in to see what the hold up is, and the bag of your food is sitting there on the counter. Who knows how long it had been there for and how many minutes I wasted due to an incompetent employee who probably thinks they should be making $15 an hour."

6351,6,3 years ago,1 star,"I am tired of the inconsistency of this particular establishment. The first thing is that this is the only McDonalds in the area that starts serving breakfast at 3 am. It is next to a club and i am sure a burger sounds better after drinking, but anyway back to the inconsistency. I show up everyday at 2:45 am and sometimes i can get a qtr pounder and other days they say it's not on the late night menu. What really bugs me is that several time I am told breakfast only! No ody shows up at that time for a mcgriddle. Stop being lazy and make the food. Most of the breakfast is ready to slap together and is why they do it, but i show up before 3 am and I want a burger! Why can't the staff get their stuff together as i wrote this review 3 people drove off because they did not want breakfast either."

6874,6,2 weeks ago,3 stars,"Everyone should take a customer service course. Not even a good morning or a smile. If you arrived badly, then you come out worse. Lol. They also don't ask about the rewards you have to tell them one."
6875,6,2 weeks ago,3 stars,"The atmosphere in general is good. They should improve the issue of bathrooms, very dirty."
6876,6,5 months ago,5 stars,"I went on Saturday to eat and I was fascinated because all the food was hot, plus the service and the speed left me speechless."
6877,6,2 months ago,5 stars,Fast and accurate service
6878,6,a year ago,1 star,"The worst Mac Donald I have ever visited in my life the treatment of the staff towards the customers is totally despicable, you practically have to get the words out of it why they look at you and talk to you with contempt the food took 34 minutes exactly when the food finally arrived it was completely cold they didn't give me glasses they didn't put napkins they didn't put sauce. Not to mention the workers inside yelling at each other. A. I almost forgot, a client returned some hamburgers because it was not as he had ordered them, they opened them, they took out the vegetables and returned it to him, that is not allowed."

6882,6,a year ago,2 stars,"The attention was not good. Neither the cashier nor the one who gave me the happy meal were kind, I asked to change the toy because my son already had it and he responded in a bad way that there was no more."
6883,6,10 months ago,1 star,"If you want to have an unpleasant time, go to the drive of this mcDonald's, they are all wrong from the first to the last and could it be that now the mcflury is just ice cream with a cookie sprinkle on top?"
6884,6,10 months ago,5 stars,"It is the ideal place to get out of the rush for a moment, to enter and eat any of its products that are good; both in its food and good and fast in the attention."
6885,6,2 years ago,1 star,"God these McDonald's people don't want to work I've gone several times at 2 in the morning and they always tell me it's the breakfast menu, and when I check on Uber the menu is the regular menu, it's just that they don't t want to make my food, and there are several times that they have done it to me really that horrible.

I do not recommend this place at all, rather they should close it, I have gone several times at 2am to place my orders and they simply say that the menu they have is for breakfast and they never want to take out my order when I go at that time, and likewise with Uber eats orders. This place is really not worth it, very disappointed in the services of all the McDonald's staff who work there, they shouldn't have people like that..."

6888,6,4 years ago,3 stars,"I really like their nuggets and the spicy mustard sauce that you can only find there, their fries are one of the best in terms of fast food, their tasty hamburgers, this chain always tries to innovate and renew the image of its establishments. some have modern tables and chairs, children have a park area where they can play, and they have a children's menu. The staff is friendly, and you can order from the car to go or also order through uber eat to have your food delivered to your home."

6914,16,8 months ago,2 stars,"This was a quick stop for a bite to tide us over with my a couple of the kids with us. We went thru the drive thru and even though it was slow business, we were put off to wait a couple of minutes and the assistant that took the order was very crisp and short in his interaction.He stated the price and told us to pay at the window where we were completely ignored for another several minutes while he (I'm assuming) took the order for the people behind us. When he finally took our payment and we moved forward to the window to receive our order, only half of the order was correct, and none of the condiments we requested were included. That kept us trying to get it sorted.
As a supervisor and a manager, I would hope review for management as well as employees could be considered in improving the atmosphere. It will be a place I will think twice before visiting again.
If you plan on stopping in, be prepared to take your time to make sure things are correct before leaving. Be accountable for your time if you want your order correct."
6915,16,7 months ago,1 star,The lobby was absolutely disgusting. Trash and food all over the floor. Staff didn't even come to the front to take orders they just expect you to use the kiosk.

6917,16,a month ago,5 stars,"I was doordashing at the time, I would never eat at McDonald's because I'm Vegan. Just want to make that clear.
This experience was not the best demonstration of a streamlined or very efficient process in expediting fast food.

The order I was waiting on took a whooping 15 minutes and was given to someone else without an apology. That being said, I would have rated them with 1 star but I decided to walk in and watch the process.
The customer service was what I would expect given the employees having to deal with the distractions from the crowd of people inquiring about their order.

* Customers can look up at the monitors above the counter to see the process of their order.

The average gluttonous ""starving"" American that eats at McDonald's behaves as though their needs are of paramount importance. It's one of the best examples you can witness of bloated self-entitlement.
McDonald's employees, you are doing a good job and on behalf of the Jerry Springer audience members that eat at your restaurant. Please forgive them."

6926,16,a month ago,4 stars,"The prices are better in Utah than Idaho or Minnesota. Also, the McDonald's app has great deals. If you do the survey on the recite than you get a buy one get one free discount.
Since I have frequented McDonald's for a long time, I must admit that I have mixed sentiments regarding the eatery. On the one side, the meal is typically pretty decent, and I like the quick and convenient service. However, there are some problems that I've come to realize over time that make me feel like the experience isn't as positive as it once was.

The rising costs of the products on the menu are one of my main worries. Every time I visit McDonald's, it seems like the costs have increased once again. This makes it challenging to continue frequenting them as much as I once did, especially with the availability of more economical fast food alternatives.

Another problem is that McDonald's used to give frequent and significant discounts and promotions, but lately they seem to be less frequent and generous. This is disappointing because I've always valued the ability to occasionally save a few dollars on my lunch.

Having said that, there are still a few aspects of McDonald's that I genuinely value. The majority of the cuisine is delicious and good, and the quickness of service is still unmatched. The restaurant is always spotless and well-kept, making it a perfect choice if you need a fast dinner on the run. Overall, I would say that McDonald's is still a good option for fast food, but because of the rising costs and less promotions, it has lost its place as my top pick. However, a typical McDonald's burger and fries are a great choice if you're searching for a quick and delectable dinner."

He requested assistance from his manager, and their solution was to add a second premium drink to the order at an up charge. All staff came across dower and melancholy.

To me, that is disgraceful and highly insulting that anyone would use rank and the military to treat people like that. I don't believe he is any sort of military let alone an officer.  And I did tell him that ""if he is a retired military officer, he is a disgrace of a former officer."" To which he wanted to go out and fight me. Furthering my belief he is no officer. I was an E-4 Specialist and know that he or any other member of any military force is trained to use rank or status as an excuse to belittle anyone.

6985,16,7 months ago,1 star,"Well earlier today. I placed 2 separate orders, but when I arrived there doors were locked, there was no letter or any sort of notice explaining why, but what confuses me more is they had people inside ordering and sitting down inside not happy with that location!!"
6986,16,9 months ago,1 star,"OK, I guess I need to stop going to ANY Mcdonalds.  Was in a hurry and ordered a double cheese and a small order of fries.  They have two pickup windows and I watched both windows handing out food.  So when the line moved up I drove to the furthest window.  and sat, and sat and watched 4 other cars pick up their food at the window behind me.   a good 5 minutes passed and I backed up to the window where the food was being handed out and the person, basically, THREW the food at me without a word.  10 steps... 10 steps to bring me my food or something... but nothing.  And then  the fries were cold and the bun on the burger was stale.   You get what you pay for and you get what you deserve if you go to a Salt Lake McDonalds."

Damn near almost ran out of gas waiting for my 1 hot n spicy sandwich with a medium fry!! No Joke!! This would probably be a pretty good McDonald's if they'd learn to put some more pep in their step!!
7006,16,a year ago,1 star,"Went to this location and went through and the first thing that happened is someone started moaning in the mic. Then we ordered 2 large fries and 1 small fry, and they tried to say we ordered 2 large drinks and a small fry it was ridiculous. They were to busy making inappropriate sounds instead of doing their job. If I could give less then one star I would. Will NOT ever come here again."

Food is getting cold and they expect you to wait and then deliver this cold food to the customer when you finally get it? What a lousy way of attending drivers, new employees or new management is much needed for this joke of a restaurant."

7018,16,2 years ago,1 star,"Working a graveyard shift in the area, I thought of grabbing a quick bite while on a quick break. Pulling into the drive-thru, after vehicles in front have ordered, female worker mumbled something about their system ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½updatingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and asked to wait. As I waited for a few moments, she then rudely told me that it was still updating and couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t take my order, even though she took an order ahead of me. I asked how long it would take, but no answer was given. I asked again, she continued to say it was updating and that she couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t take my order. I finally started putting in a mobile order to make it easier on their end, but she got back on again and rudely said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ho while their system updated. So I decided to leave to find another place to grab a quick bite, only to hear her say that she did mention they were closed if I were listening to her.

Another driver in the other stall was having the same issue with another male employee, but was actually nice enough to let them know they were temporarily closed until further notice.

Clear unprofessional attitude from this female employee. Definitely needs to be taught better in respect and in having better customer service skills. Guess when you get paid minimum wage, Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d be miserable too. Bu"

7020,16,a year ago,2 stars,The dining room is neglected every morning at this location. So much so that the workers refuse to take orders at the register. You have to use the keosks and if you want a sausage biscuit in a meal there is no way to order it with cheese in a meal.  Half the time the soda says it's out of stock unless you order a meal. Floor is filthy in front of the soda machines. Lids not stocked. Garbages in dining room full to overflowing. Kid came out and cleaned ALL the tables with the same cloth and no cleaning spray whatsoever.

7024,16,a year ago,5 stars,The food was good the price was reasonable and the people at the drive-thru were very kind. We got through in a reasonable amount of time.

7032,16,8 months ago,4 stars,Literally the best mcdonalds to go to in the early early a.m. but watch out for the overcooked or stale fries. Hardly ever been there and systems updating or down so it's my go to spot when alot of places are closed.
7033,16,a year ago,1 star,"Posting this review in hopes that someone sees it. My number one complaint is the hours listed; it says 24hrs but that is not true. I'm not sure when they actually close, but I've been there at midnight, way later around 2am and 3am, and they're closed. The funny thing is that there's usually someone inside to tell me that they're closed.. I don't mind that they close early, but they need to correct their hours if that's the case. I frequently get off work rather late and I'm usually pretty hungry, I can go somewhere else but this location ~would~ be convenient for me for how close it is to my work. It's also frustrating that they allow me to pay on the app and then not get my food. Please adjust your hours online and on the app so people like me don't get their hopes up."

And to the Watson group that owns this location, I'm going to make sure that I spread the word not to visit this location because of James. We waited over 10 minutes because you had only one drive thru open and things were going slow. Well the clock just turned to 11 and we wanted breakfast. They told us no. Even though we were in line long before then and it is not our fault that everything was going slow. I called James and I was upset. I didn't swear but instead of him understanding how this would be frustrating, he just kept giving excuse after excuse and then whined that he wasn't going to talk anymore and hung up on me. Like I said, I didn't swear but I let him know that it was rude how they treat people. IF I CAN GIVE ZERO BECAUSE OF JAMES, I WOULD! Learn to understand your customers.

I told her I am on a bicycle, not a walk-up. She told me she was cancelling my order. Needless to say, no McDonald's that night, and now the company has lost my business."

It was 3am when I went and I'm sure the employees were tired because it was so busy but Angel and Anthony at this location specifically were SO nice and happy.

This isnt the best mcdonalds around thats for sure....staff is kind of rude and has their music blaring. Also i was waiting for my food and one of the workers came up and asked if i was waiting for someone like it was a problem i was there. Only go here if i absolutely have to....last resort for sure. I rather go to a location further from my house to get better service.
7055,16,a year ago,2 stars,These was the 2nd time I had this problem with the same McDonald's. I was hoping that the first time just some kind of mistake. So I fell for it twice.  And at the redickuless price they get like $4 for like 1/4 of a potato. 10 lb for that price in the store.  It will not be happening again! No more fries from this place!!! And all over 1 cents worth of salt. Lmao

The trans woman who works nights is ALWAYS SO RUDE, she's the reason I don't go to this location anymore. She goes out of her way to make it so you can't use coupons from the app as well. For example the buy one get one free for quarter pounder, big mac, etc. It can only be used when the sandwiches are rung in not in a meal, she knows this and purposely puts 1 in a meal so that your coupon won't work and when you ask to have it removed from the meal she says no so you have to pay double. Always an attitude. Go to another location nearby."

It's 1230 in the morning, no line and the kid working says it's going to take an hour.  When I knownfor a fact it takes about 10 to 15 min. I had placed an order on the app using my free points. Looking to get a quick bite on my Sunday night walk home from my usual business and now I'm down from 2600 points to 100 points...AND STILL HUNGARY!!!! Yall lucky you get a 2 star.. update I now have 1600 points O.o. yall need to properly train your staff and quite frankly I think you should just overhaul the entire place with new staff because what you have now..SUX!"
7070,16,2 years ago,5 stars,In that whole area that is the best McDonald's they have extremely and friendly employees there very personable. The drive-thru is very fast they are very friendly they repeat orders back to you asked if you would like your receipt ask how your day has been. The parking lot is very clean considering that that area has a lot of problems with litter. Their sodas are always refreshing and cold they don't ever taste watery. they put together their hamburgers meet me so the Patty or the sauces are not dripping or the patties falling out of the bun. I very much recommend this McDonald's than any other McDonald's in the area.

7075,16,2 years ago,1 star,Ordered a Chocolate Shake and they gave me a mixture of chocolate and mint. I drove back and asked them to fix it. They made me wait 5 minute and gave me a mixture of mainly vanilla ice cream. When I asked they told me thay the machine was not working right! What a ripoff!
7076,16,a year ago,1 star,I can't remember the time I got good fries from them.   Once in a while there are good employees there that make up for it but I have simply dropped this place from my list of places to go after the last few times I've eaten there.  I should say this is for all McDonald's

7078,16,a year ago,5 stars,McDonald's as most people already know is one of the most popular burger places. At this location service was pretty good and everything but the thing was that when we got a happy meal the box was the Eternals theme but the toy was from Encanto.

7083,16,2 years ago,1 star,"So my boyfriend and I ordered a large fries and 2 large drinks. We get to the window to pay l Had a coupon on the app for the large fries. Then I was paying for the rest on venmo. The girl at the register had no idea what she was doing. She had the assistant manager come help her she had no idea what she was doing... Then the manager came and we had now told them over 7 times to just take off the drinks... The manager still had a hard time....
How hard is it to take 2 drinks off an order.
He then was trying to say we had to pay for the fries. He eventually just let us have the fries for free. We also had a second order with another large fries. (we had 2 phone's with Free fries)
They were all rude and didn't care about us at all.

7090,16,5 years ago,1 star,We were visiting. From out of town and came through the drive through for some breakfast. The bacon egg and cheese biscuit was so hard it must have been under the warming light for hours!! It was impossible to eat. My sausage mcmuffin was so dry - not at all what I am used to and I order these regularly. After getting to our hotel room (less than 10 minutes from there) and finding out how terrible our breakfast was we called to let the manager know. Not only did she insinuate that we were lying but was less than professional by far. I have not complained to a fast food establishment for over 4 years. So when I feel food is this substandard and take time out to call I would have expected some common courtesy not an ignorant attitude especially from management. Needless to say when I come back this way I will not be eating at this location. If I were you I wouldn't either!! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿

7094,16,7 years ago,3 stars,"I come here quite often, and for the most part, it's a normal McDonald's. There is one manager here that frequently yells at his employees for no reason at all, IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMERS! I honestly feel bad that they have to be treated like that because apparently the manager doesn't understand that places get busy and there will be a wait a bit longer than usual. This location always has homeless people standing/sitting at each exit of the parking lot. One hot, summer day, I was leaving this McDonald's and made the mistake of putting down my windows down before leaving the parking lot. I was stopped by one homeless man and he asked for money, and usually I don't carry cash, but I happened to have a couple quarters in my car, so I gave them to him and he thanked me for helping him and his brother out. I pulled forward a bit more, and his brother stood up, walked over to my car, and I thought he was just going to thank me for the money, but nope! He literally started climbing inside my car to get some food from the passenger seat. He was grabbing me, and had his hands on my steering wheel and I started driving away to get him to stop after offering him some more quarters so he could buy his own food, and he kept yelling at me saying that he wanted the food I had. In the end, I left being robbed of the few bucks I had in coins in my car, and feeling very much violated. Again, this could have been avoided by having my windows up, but I thought it would be worth including that experience in my review. Really not a bad place, but definitely not the best."

If you're going to close update your hours so I don't waste my time driving all the way to you only to have to drive all the way to 2100 south.

Maybe you should stop paying starvation wages and you'd be able to hire an extra hand to help clean lol."

7104,16,2 years ago,3 stars,I've been a few times and 50% of the time it's been great with prompt service and order right but the other half of the time it was long wait and order wrong..  Like I asked for hot n spicy with cheese and double cheeseburger and my burger had one patty and 2 pieces of cheese and the hot n spicy didn't have cheese and the chicken was really dried out and old.. So it's a toss of the dice on how it is... But they are 24 hour so I still go lol

7106,16,6 years ago,1 star,"They charged me for a medium drink for my nieces happy meal, didn't ask for a medium drink. The guy who handed me my food barely acknowledged we were there at the window. He practically threw our food in our window while not even looking. Almost dropped our drinks. He was just shoving our food and drinks out his window blindly. I asked him why we had a medium drink he said he didn't know because it was all automatic. The cashier didn't give us our receipt so I asked him if I could get a copy of my receipt. He stormed off and comes back about a minute later shoves the receipt in my face and tells me if I want a copy of my receipt I need to ask at the first window. I just wanted to know about the medium drink otherwise I wouldn't have needed a copy of my receipt or if the cashier would have given me one I wouldn't have had to ask. Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Never making that mistake again."

7112,16,3 years ago,1 star,I was staying next door at the hotel and decided to stop in for breakfast sandwich and the sandwich was nasty wasn't cooked. But my #1 reason for the one star is the way the manager spoke to her worker in front of customers this was on 9/23/2019. I was like WOW really... Talk to people the way you would want to be spoken to. If you want to be rude talk to the person in the back. But otherwise learn to be a better manager that was unacceptable.

What they fail to mention on their hours of operation is at Midnight is that they are not able to take any Orders because their system is updating for at least 45min.

I was somewhat confused and a bit worried about my LG. Coffee and a set of gloves.so my question  is why.

What those nice people don't know is I'm diabetic and my blood sugar was crashing cuz my car suddenly broke down a block away. Just when the cashier told us of the kindness, the tow guy called... he was one hour early! I didn't even see what type of car the kind people drove or get to wave thanks. I must add that my fish sandwich came with the extra sauce and the French fries were piping hot. Perfect ice in the drink and the right mix, too. They even gave us extra napkins! Can I just say a very humble thank you to all involved?"

We ordered off of their little automated order taking thing which we had never done before and got our orders and headed back to the hotel. When we got back to the hotel I noticed that they had given me one of their $1 spicy chicken sandwichs instead of $1 cheeseburger I had ordered but as it was late and only over a dollar I didn't feel like going back to correct it. But the rest of the order was correct and as far as the quality of the food I guess it was as decent as fast food from McDonald's can be
7130,16,a year ago,1 star,"Called to confirm I could order using the app and walk up to pick up my order as I am staying at a hotel nearby. Other McDonalds just bring it to you outside the door when the lobby is closed.

We stayed at a hotel and wanted some nice hot chocolate and cookies and the cookies were hard as a rock and the hot chocolate was disgusting! It was hot water with peppermint. On top of it the customer service was awful. They refuse to take your order and make you do it on their machines. If u have questions too bad. We went back three times and they still got it wrong.

I continued to the front, parked the scooter AGAIN, and went straight to the manager to vent my complaint about the treatment I had received.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Initially, the complaint was well and openly received by a young, demur manager on duty, and she apologized for the treatment.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I also explained that I lived in the area, frequented this McDï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s, and that I would rather inconvenience myself and go an additional mile and a half to Burger King than spend one dime at this McDï¿½ive change in their employees, or the District/Corporate Big-Wigs are allowing this to happen.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The lack of customer service and concern is appalling---especially for a name like McDonalds!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I stormed out and left in disgust!

7135,16,4 years ago,3 stars,"I ordered around midnight and it was fairly busy; about 7 people in line for the drivethru. I order all my fries with no salt for a few reasons.. 1. I was sick of always getting cold fries.  2. They put way too much salt on these days...
I needed to add something to my order at the end,  and apologized thoroughly, as i have worked fast food and understand the annoyance.
The guy that helped me did not say one word in response about it, which was rather rude.
My change in order did not take any extra time,  and by the time i got my fries... guess what?
They were cold."
7136,16,5 years ago,3 stars,"Staff was okay. They messed up our order twice, and then forgot about us when they had us pull forward at the drive through. Other than that, it's a good McDonalds. It's clean, the food is the same as every other one, and it's got a pretty decent location."
7137,16,a year ago,1 star,"Was craving a breakfast sandwich, but they stopped selling those all day. Then I shifted to a chicken sandwich, but they only sell the spicy version now. Sadly, I drove away with no food..."

7139,16,a year ago,2 stars,Frys were cool and soggy. The double quarter pounder w/cheese was slapped together were one beef paddy going one way and the other one going the other. It was stuck that which made it hard to eat.
7140,16,a year ago,4 stars,I spend a lot of money at this location and I haven't really ever had a bad experience the only downfall with this restaurant is it states that it is 24 hours yet it is closed during hours of the night and as I just stopped to get my breakfast this morning after 6:00 a.m. it was closed again sometimes they are even closed in the middle of the day so it is not always open as stated but it has always treated me well when it comes to customer service and food quality
7141,16,2 years ago,5 stars,"Went at about 3 am and ordered at the drive thru. Was very impressed with their service! All of my food was fresh, and it couldn't have been a better experience. Great job!"
7142,16,a year ago,5 stars,"The two employees running the store the evening I went were completely overwhelmed, and yet still managed to give great service with a smile. These guys deserve a raise."
7143,16,a year ago,5 stars,Ice cream cone was perfect.  MC DONALD diet coke is the closest thing to coke zero since they calibrate their machines for a perfect soda and purify there water.  THANK YOU MC'DS
7144,16,3 years ago,3 stars,There was nobody at the register for about 5 minutes and one customer walked out. The burger I got had Gouda cheese which tasted good but the bun was soggy and flat like it was on a warmer for some time. They didn't have AARP specials but the manager offered a special anyway.
7145,16,4 years ago,4 stars,"Always professional and quick, very convenient on the way to the highway. Do not park here if you're just going to the liquor store, i have been booted before. Still come here though, cause good service."
7146,16,3 years ago,3 stars,"My neighborhood McDonald's and it's meh... lack luster service especially inside. They gotta keep the drive through times down so the dining room service is at best a ""C"". The security people there are always pressuring people to leave. Its assumed you're homeless or a bum so security gives you a time in which you've got to go. Then there's the food. I suggest a 5 - 10 minute walk to Apollo Burger."
7147,16,2 months ago,2 stars,This is more of a homeless shelter than a McDonald's
7148,16,4 years ago,2 stars,"First and last time to this McDonald's. Had to stand around for 20 mins aside from only 2 people being there. One employee caught an attitude when i asked for no pickles. None of the burgers were wrapped right. And they were so lazy about they job that at first they wouldn't even come to the register to take my order. Kept staring at me expecting me to use their damn machine.
Customer service and being polite goes a long way ladies! And learn how to wrap your food."
7149,16,8 months ago,1 star,I ordered 2 big macs. They had no meat. No patties. Seriously?
7150,16,6 years ago,1 star,This place is very dirty the employees are very rude. They got mad cause we asked for ketchup. Then we stayed in to eat and the employees are talking and putting down all the customers. They have been putting the men and lady's in the same bathroom cause the men's is closed and then my daughter went to use the bathroom the lady up front said there is 2 men in there cause there is closed. So she went in then the security guard need to use it and then the employees where talking about my daughter I went up there and told them that If they would take better Care and clean your place it would be up. Plus you have food over every where they don't wash there hands they don't clean the tables then you ask for a wash cloth to clean they say we don't have any clean. There is so many drug dealers here even the workers are sale I ng inside in the lobby in the parking lot.. I will never come here again I'm also calling the cops on the drug deals I seen. Even with a security guard on duty he just looks the other way.. DO NOT EVER COME HERE

7153,16,3 years ago,5 stars,I like the way they do the egg McMuffin with sausage here. I think it's just the muffins aren't toasted so much so they're a little softer everything else seems fresh and tasty. This one happens to have a bunch of one-way streets around it but soon as you know that you can figure out how to get in and out. Fast service in the Drive-Thru no complaints.
7154,16,4 years ago,1 star,"Ordered a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit meal, and they give me no bacon! They did send me 2 complimentary meals which was great. I go back with the free coupon and they gave me a chicken sandwich when I ordered a signature burger. Called their office to let them know and they did not care. Now I call Corporate in Chicago, how do you like me now????"
7155,16,6 years ago,1 star,"The worst drive thru service I've ever had anywhere. From the time I started paying attention to how long I was waiting in line til the time I was given my food was 48 mins. At least 10 mins before that I was waiting in line not paying attention to how long I'd been there.  So roughly an hour to get my food. Then only to be treated rudely  by the cashier, because somehow I was supposed to know they wanted cash only. Not sure why, since I had no choice but to run my debit card and it went through just fine and in a normal amount of time. I'll never go there again. I'll drive a few mins to another location."
7156,16,5 years ago,5 stars,"Went thru the drive thru around 6am on a Saturday morning. The attendant who took my order was very thorough and most importantly very friendly. When I was handed my order by another very friendly attendant, my order was correct, fresh, and delicious. Best McDonald's service I have ever experienced. Thank you team for starting my morning right!"
7157,16,10 months ago,5 stars,Friendly staff. Was even offered a position. Yet I could not accept due to my being homeless at the moment..
7158,16,7 years ago,1 star,"I don't go to McDonald's often but I've been here twice in the last year, both times were terrible. I went through the drive through both times. One time during the lunch hour, I didn't  get one of my burgers. I got the rest of a meal but the quarter pounder never made it  in the bag. I didn't know until I got home. Tonight I waited 20 minutes, no exaggeration, to get 1 burger from the line. I will never go here again I should have just driven home to eat. It would have been faster."
7159,16,7 years ago,1 star,"this place sucks. two of the employees were yelling at each other, super immaturely. the store was disgusting, it took forever to order, and even longer to get our food. like I said, the management sucked. the employee he was arguing with just quit on the spot, saying ""I'm outta here"" and just left after being asked to do his job. entertainment value is five stars, quality is one star."
7160,16,a year ago,5 stars,"So you pretty much can only turn right leaving this mcslappys so we always just go a lil farther down freedom to watch the sk8boarders while we eat.
Heads up, the spoons for the mcflurry are not also straws. I feel like i kill a dolphin everytime i get one, ain't no way that spoon takes less than 1 billion years to decompose.
If you take the bottoms off two basic hamburgers and slap them boys on top and bottom of a chicken sando, you get a McOreoï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"
7161,16,5 years ago,2 stars,"Was forced to use the kiosk. If you need to pay in cash, you have to still use the kiosk then go the the cashier with your receipt and pay. Check out takes a lot more time, the food is not prepared any faster, and the dining room or bathrooms aren't any cleaner. So there is no advantage to the customer."
7162,16,4 years ago,1 star,"10/11/2018 - Zero stars if offered. Employees and superiors lack customer satisfaction service.
Because employees follow lead of supervisors, can do attitudes are can't and won't.
In regards of coffee and soft drinks, we were told it is 'their policy ' to not offer refills due to high levels of homeless.
(What an awful thing to say.)
The restrooms are locked. To exit restrooms, one must know (we did not) to press a button in order for the door to unlock.
Definitely not the McDonald's for us. We would not be surprised if higher management reads this review then ultimately 'bar' us from their establishment even though we shall not return to this McDonald's location."
7163,16,a year ago,4 stars,"Went here at midnight. Staff was nice, quick and effective. Long line and the staff didn't waste any time."
7164,16,7 years ago,1 star,"So incredibly slow once the bars closed and the drunks got hungry. Fries were old, not hot. Disorder with the 2 drive through lanes. 3 cars in the outside lane back to back to back ordered (2 if those cars should have been behind my order) while our car (knowing what we were ordering, given we had at least 20 minutes waiting in line just to get to the ordering board/microphone speaker) sat at the menu for over 5 minutes waiting to order. Overall, our drive-through wait time was forty, YES 40!!!, minutes. Will NOT go there again. Also the frequent harassment made by the half dozen homeless people begging for either money, cigarettes, food, or to wash our Windows. Clearly, they should have picked up on our lack of patience at that point and left us the %@#! Alone. McDonalds staff or management should fix that problem for others as well."
7165,16,7 years ago,1 star,"I am highly enraged with their service. They didn't specify on their signs in the parking lot that I couldn't leave the parking lot for more than five minutes. They booted my truck and I had to pay him with my food in hand. I've tried talking to the store manager, McDonald's main office and submitted a complaint. All I get it's the run around, hung up on and berated. I'm not much for posting these kinds of things, but I'm out money I feel wasn't owed, and feel highly taken advantage of."
7166,16,3 years ago,5 stars,"Probably the fastest, most simple and delicious experience I have had with McDonald's so far. The management is on top of it with the system they have going. I really respect that after the many disappointments I have had with McDonald's before.  They know what they're doing at this location! It's great!"
7167,16,4 years ago,1 star,There was blood on the womens bathroom toilet I told the old cashier and she said o well! I tried talking the manager and she completely ignored me I tried calling the number on my receipt 4 different times and everytime I got a busy signal. My daughter and I were standing off to the side waiting for our drinks and thank god after seeing the kitchen area we did not order food I was completely and utterly disgusting!!!!! Please do not go to this McDonalds! I rated it 1 star only because I had to rate it to leave this to bad!!
7168,16,4 years ago,2 stars,"McDonalds was fine; the people I went with sucked. But honestly this place is really sketch, they even have a security guard at the front door in case things go sideways. If you are wondering HOW things could go sideways, you wouldn't have to expand your view further then the amount of druggys that go to this McDonalds. Half of them don't even buy anything, they just stand around (to heat up I presume) waiting for the security to kick them out. The other half stand in line and figure out that they can't buy anything at the front desk then leave. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this if they kept to themselves like everyone else ordering something at the McDonald's, but they would  randomly yell, ask questions, pan handle, and just were being a general nuisance. I understand that an establishment can't control who their costumers are, so it's not exactly the MD's fault, but still this Micky D's should be avoided at all costs for that reason. I give them 2 stars instead of one because the good customer service and magically clean bathroom. Seriously these cashiers have to deal with a lot of weird stuff and they somehow aren't mentally broken by the end of the day. I went at 11 at night which probably affects my review, but from the first impression I'm not inclined to go again to find out how it is in the day unless it was simultaneously the only restaurant, I was starving more than a communist in the gulag, and I lost my ability to cook food myself. Seriously don't go here it's horrible."
7169,16,2 years ago,5 stars,"They are so fast here!  I'm kind of picky, so I order my stuff without ""this"" or with ""that"" and they get it right every time and keep the line moving!  Friendly people too!"
7170,16,a year ago,1 star,"Zero customer service skills. They don't even acknowledge yor presence. You talk to them and besides taking your order and your money, they don't even thank you for shopping there."
7171,16,7 years ago,1 star,"I don't like cold fries. No one does. When a sign says Customer Parking only, does that exclude customers 10 minutes into the future? I have waited longer than that in this location's drive-through. I had a combo stop to make. Pick up some rum and bring home some dinner for me and the wife. I parked at McDonald's and walked the 65 seconds or so to the liquor store. A purchase and the return voyage took all of five minutes. By the time I had returned, there was a boot on my car. The person responsible for this was in the parking lot and informed me that to be considered a McDonald's customer, I would have had to make my fast-food purchase first, and then been given  30 minutes in the parking lot. It's a cold November evening. Fast food sitting in a car would be cold by the time I had returned, so I did things in what seemed like the logical order. $90 later, I was too disgusted to eat. I went into the store to file a complaint, but was bullied out by the towing staff. This isn't a predatory company per se, but they're in bed with one."
7172,16,3 years ago,1 star,Literally the worstMcD's in the world. Going through drive thru she gave us our drinks and told us to pull forward by door...then blocking the person behind us from getting out. We took initiative and parked in th he drive thru spot. Husband then went in to find out what was happening...defeating the point of drive thru. He said the staff were abysmally slow taking forever to put each item in the bag. We were starving but only ate a little. I've never had McDonald's where grease runs down your arms and the fries were revoltingly greasy too. Surprisingly none of us got food poisoning.
7173,16,5 years ago,1 star,"I was driving through the area with a friend and had to settle for this McDonald's after an hour and a half search for an open location that would serve me. However, I found out this location also did not have a working ice cream machine. How can all the machines be down in a city at once? This is some terrible service. My drive thru order taker was rude and had no idea how to process a cash payment. The driving lanes are also an apparent problem for the usual people coming here at night as two vehicles swerved into me and attempted to go in front of me in order to exit while I was at the ordering spot."
7174,16,4 years ago,1 star,"Poor slow service an older man came to my table showed me words on his phone saying I had 30 minutes to finish my food and leave.
I asked the cashier about the Man and he claimed he is security and that even though I had paid for my items I could only be there 30 minutes.
I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told there was not one on duty that day. I then asked for corporate office phone number and was told they don't have it.
Very rude way to treat anyone at all."

I let someone know to come clean it but she just came in, looked at it and left. I was in a hurry with three children, so we had to cycle through using one stall and there was a constant line forming behind us. If my kids didn't have to go so badly, we would have gone somewhere else. I would never stop there again."

Currently McDonalds is doing a buy one get one for a dollar. 10 piece McNuggets, quarter pounder with cheese and a Big Mac! Instead of just charging me what a normal 10 piece and then add a 1$ for a second one they made me pay 3$ more for a 20"
7179,16,5 years ago,4 stars,Nice new remodel. Clean and well maintained. Good food.
7180,16,a year ago,1 star,Could you update the lobby hours? It seems to change every two weeks. With the pandemic going on the least you can do is not waste anyone's time.
7181,16,8 years ago,5 stars,"really this is a 4.5 star review. this McDonald's is located downtown salt lake city and everyone who lives here knows that parking downtown is almost impossible sometimes. Now mind you this parking lot is massive for McDonald's. way bigger than what the store needs. so people try to take advantage of McDonald's by parking here and going elsewhere.

For those idiots that are crying about their car getting booted, they were obviously trying to take advantage - even if they were McDonald's customers. There's signs posted all over that are plain as day stating 30 minute parking only otherwise subject to getting booted or towed.  the sign also blatantly says DO NOT LEAVE THESE PREMISES WITHOUT YOUR VEHICLE. so for everyone else crying, try reading the freaking sign. You know those metal signs cost money and they weren't custom made for entertainment or cosmetic purposes. use your brains......

on another note I visited here my first time just now. food was as expected for McDonald's but it's not like a good cook could make that any better. staff was fast, friendly, and effective. And my order was accurate. -.5 a star for closing the lobby at night but once again I don't blame them. There's a lot of crazies out there especially in the midnight and early morning hours."

7184,16,4 years ago,1 star,Staff was unfriendly and food tasted old. The fried onions on my signature hamburger tasted burnt. We had just got out of a concert and they were busy but our fries tasted like they had been sitting around for 20 - 30 minutes. It was gross
7185,16,2 years ago,1 star,"Horrible service, the drive through associates just ask you what else they can get for you. I literally told them thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s all 4 times and could hear other employees laughing "
7186,16,4 years ago,1 star,Ordered their signature Double BBQ Burger tonight at the drive thru... One patty wasn't even cooked.... The buns were burnt black instead of toasted. Fries came out cold. My wife ordered a #6 Chicken Nuggets with BBQ sauce.... Didn't get her sauce and nuggets were cold as well. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!
7187,16,4 years ago,3 stars,"The reason why I'm keeping this McDonald's three stars is because the customer service was great. Although, the food wasn't that great honestly, I've had better McDonald's McChicken was felt like it was just warmed up in the microwave the bread was stale and the fries were great because I like to order my fries with no salt and if you're looking for some fresh fries remember to order fries with no salt. The parking-lot was clean. The inside of the McDonald's cooking area looked really clean and spic and span the only reason why I'm giving it three stars is because the food quality was not great at all so if you can improve that then you can either get another star or two more stars it depends on what you guys want for you to McDonalds."
7188,16,2 years ago,1 star,The employees at this location threaten my sister in-law because she asked for a happy meal she ordered but didn't get. The manager needs to hire people who don't threaten their customers.
7189,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Seriously this is the absolute worst service I've ever had. The manager, is lazy and we sat in the drive thru for 15 damn minutes. We pulled up to the first window, and he opens the window and sits there talking and completely ignored us. Then we pay and pull up to the 2nd window and literally, 3 employees are sitting there talking. We're at 15 minutes and counting and still sitting at the 2nd window. All for 2 hash browns and a sandwhich."
7190,16,5 years ago,1 star,"The drive through is open during construction but the it took almost 15 minutes of waiting at the window, then the manager handed me the food and drink while loudly arguing with a co-worker about how they don't like working together.

7192,16,2 years ago,3 stars,McDonald's has been around since the dark ages it seems and they have always been a pretty good place to enjoy fast food. But lately the food hasn't improved any but the prices have skyrocketed and I refuse to go there anymore for what you pay for their meals you could dine out someplace with a lot more ambiance and social attractiveness.

7194,16,3 years ago,3 stars,"If you want to meet angry homeless people who leave a giant mess at the counter-height seating area and then practically acost you for sitting at THEIR spot when they return from 20 minutes destroying the restroom to find that you, as a customer, have cleaned the wrappers off of the counter, wiped it down, and seated yourself for a meal, you COULD think McDonald's. Fortunately for this particular location, the staff are all very nice and the food is as good as McDonald's gets. Homeless people need to eat, too... forgive me for 'cleaning up' and not thinking anyone was there. It really was just a pile of trash. I wasn't trying to ruin anyone's day. Oh, well, you can't win 'em all!"
7195,16,4 years ago,1 star,"At first glance the place looks good but the first quarter pounder was cold and when I watched them fix the second I found the the commercial about being cooked fresh is bs. They pulled the meat from a drawer and it was barely warmer than the first. Then the flies inside were all over everything. Yuk... the last time I will come here. Right before I left a guy came in and tried to get some water and a rude sweaty security guard was stopping him. Wow, this place is not where I would take family."
7196,16,2 years ago,5 stars,This McDonalds was the perfect way to end our night at the Quarters bar. Their staff was friendly and fast and they had the new pokemon happy meals even though we came at 1:30 in the morning. We even got the rare holographic pikachu pokemon card as a toy in the happy meal.
7197,16,a year ago,3 stars,Food was typical. They messed up on my drink but this is something that commonly occurs at most McDonald's. The drive-thru was very slow but that could be because they are short staffed?
7198,16,6 years ago,1 star,Fifteen minute wait in the drive through. They don't pull cars aside with larger orders to keep the line moving. Predatory booting person roaming the lot... You'll probably be more comfortable with police supervising the exchange if you happen to get booted.
7199,16,3 years ago,5 stars,"Employees this time are little less stressed. Also the new look of the store compared with the old 200 years old one makes everything else easier, even dealing with those always non conformist customers"
7200,16,5 years ago,1 star,So 4:20 in the morning obviously means something else to this McDonald's.  No coffee made up. The jerk at the window couldn't have been more rude and put off that we were there.  Today we were up early to start our long drive home after what was a very nice weekend in Salt Lake City.  If this is the impression McDonald's wants to leave the. I am happy to never frequent any of their establishments.  15 minutes from the time we paid til the we got our food in the drive through and two cars behind us got theirs ahead of us.  All we ordered were two cokes and two sausage biscuits.
7201,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Spent over 20 minutes in line to be told that only serve breakfast at 2am, even though their menu said lunch also.  Then told they were out of almost everything.  Don't waste your time going here at night.  I've gone two separate times and had seriously awful experiences.  Don't go here, there's a Denny's near by, and several gas stations with better service and better food."
7202,16,6 years ago,2 stars,Picture a mcdonalds in a pretty rough area. They have a security guard. You need permission to go in the bathroom. People are begging. Seems dirty. You can't expect it to be the best one. The staff seem friendly for the most part and my food comes out fairly fast tastes decent . I have noticed the buns are stale slightly around the edge at this location more than once. I haven't had that happen at any others really. I wonder why that is?
7203,16,4 years ago,3 stars,"The employees were friendly, little stressed. They had a manager who called in at the last minute. The manager didn't cover their shift leaving the employees understaffed. The employee's did a good job being understaffed & having the am rush. Coffee was great, the wait to long. This is I believe on 5th ave n. We were leaveing SL to go to Tooele."
7204,16,5 years ago,1 star,"I understand you're under construction but your employees are ridiculous. The employee that shuttles the money was one his cell phone the entire time. I gave him a $10 and told him I had the correct change but he just walked off, still on his phone. Also, if I order and pay for a medium fry, I don't want a small amount in a medium container just thrown in the bag."
7205,16,3 years ago,5 stars,The franchise is good - Years ago when I ate there regularly - the owner would be there often - she worked onthe line and if you didn't know her you would never know.  Went back recently - I don't know if she still works in the store - but it was as good as I remembered
7206,16,2 years ago,1 star,Horrible experience. Waited for over 30mins in the drive thru to have them forget part of our order. Not to mention they couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t figure out 
7207,16,4 years ago,1 star,"This McDs SUCKS. Their food is disgusting and their service sucks. They forgot my kids entire happy meal and when they brought it out there was no toy and no chicken nuggets. We ordered sundaes to go and they delivered it to a random table and took some other guys marker. And to top it all off they were RUDE, like it was my fault they suck at their job. This is the absolute WORST experience I've ever had at a restaurant ever."
7208,16,5 years ago,1 star,"We were going to the Children's museum & my granddaughter wanted McDonald. Apparently at this location they will only take your order in the drive-thru. We had to call over the counter for help. We were told that we had to order from the kiosk. I explained to them that I had cash. They told me that I still needed to order from the kiosk & then pay cash at the counter...what...then why won't they just take my order??? Then we had to call over the counter a 2nd time because we were struggling with the kiosk. The lady that came out said I had to order my meal a la carte...what!!! Needless to say, we walked out & will  NEVER return!!! If it's such an inconvenience to take people's orders inside maybe they should close the lobby at this location & only have the drive-thru. From the way people were treated while I was there & reading other reviews apparently the customers inside real do NOT matter. I'm surprised that McDonald's would allow a location (franchise) to treat customers this way."
7209,16,4 years ago,1 star,I went to order Sweet and Spicy glazed tenders. I said it numerous times and the drive through kept asking what sauce I wanted. Should be obvious Sweet and Spicy  glaze . I left there and went to McDonald's on 1700 S.  Redwood Road . Much better service and food is what I ordered.
7210,16,4 years ago,4 stars,"I would love the exact location McDonald's i dined at. This one employee only seemed to be against having me eat there. The woman cashier literally did'nt want to order with the 2 for one menu sandwich deal i just recieved on on my phone. She wouldn't offer me a pen to write my code on the receipt, so i used a penny to write the code, so she tells me it's invalid, but i wrote the exact code and it looked as though i wrote in oencile. She immediately try calling security, so i asked the other employees for a manager. The manager was very understanding, and even after helped with all and left to the back, the woman tells me how this is my last order and i have 14 minutes left to eat. It was ammusing so i played the idiot customer roll. I definitely appreciate the manager's understanding for i was also a little short on exact cash, so you can already guess how the woman treated me about that. On the plus side I enjoyed my meal !!"
7211,16,5 years ago,1 star,"This Store is the highest priced store, probably the most unfriendly and unprofessional in Utah. The heavy set Hispanic lady at the counter had just taken an order from the young man a head of me and would not take my order. She was going to make me do my order on the kiosk. When I told here no, that I would go somewhere else before I would do that, she told me goodbye. Yes, I am done with mcdonalds. You are not getting another dime of my hard earned money ever. if you continue these business tactics I will be happy to hear you are in bankruptcy. Enjoy the time you have left. Just a side note I have been going to this mcdonalds for over 3 years at least one day per week. Never again! Good thing Wendy's right around the corner was more than happy to take my order and my money. Funny part is Wendy's double burger had more meat and tasted better and the price was almost a dollar cheaper."
7212,16,4 years ago,1 star,"I bought two coffees for my twin and I, planned to buy some food tried to use the bathroom first it wasn't available for 45 minutes so I left without purchasing anything else.
That's a zero rating but I need 1 to post."
7213,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Went inside to get service faster, oh was I wrong! Waiting for more than an hour to be served, paid at the touchscreen, got cups to serve drinks and soda was terrible, other people left and requested a refund, people got fired this same night,  Elderly people were still waiting to get some food and told me about their bad experience, they seem to be patient but dang this has to be the worst experience in a McDonald's ever. We are Never coming back."
7214,16,5 years ago,1 star,First My Hamburger Was Ugly. It Had The Ketchup All Over The Place!! Next My Fries Were Super Salty And Some Way To Crispy. And Lastly My Shake Tasted Horrible! You Could Taste All The Syrup And There Was No Cherry. The Only Good Thing About My Trip Was Their Playground.
7215,16,4 years ago,1 star,What a joke I went to this McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s I work at Gateway got some chicken nuggets asked for an extra  sweet-and-sour sauce on top of the two that they usually give you was very nice to the lady didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t say youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re welcome when I said thank you and did not put my sauce in the bag no I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
7216,16,5 years ago,5 stars,"They have cleaned it up!! There is a security guard who works for McDonald's to keep the riff raff out!  Its clean, nice, and calm.  I definetly recommend going here.  There is no locks on the bathroom even.  I was impressed and will go back when I'm downtown again."
7217,16,3 years ago,2 stars,"Fast food, fast service. Low quality meals. But, you will probably already know that because it is a McDonald's fast-food, and not a whole foods Cafe organic foods.
The food price is above normal for what you are getting. So, the value is low in the area of food quality for the price. What you are paying for is convenience. They have a very fast drive-thru."
7218,16,11 months ago,1 star,"Sat waiting for several minutes before asking for help several times, i said typical bs and backed up to enter other lane when i heard a man laughing from the mic and saying hello."
7219,16,6 years ago,3 stars,"It's in a bad part of town. A lot of homeless and panhandlers. Bathroom are locked, security watches you... it's an uncomfortable feeling. Not really a good place to take the kids for dinning in. But their service is okay and quick. Their food is standard McDonald's service. Nothing special about it. And this McDonald's sometimes Jack's up their prices cause they say they're ""downtown"" which to me means nothing but everything downtown costs more. McDonald's should not cost more ..."
7220,16,3 years ago,1 star,"Horrible. Bad customer service, awful food (cold, hot and spicys were burnt, fries were half empty, cold, and just tasted like oil), just a bad experience overall. Location on 700 east and 250 south is definitely worth the extra few minuteï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"

7222,16,7 years ago,1 star,I feel that it is OK to charge to use the restrooms. Yet they are so gross it's not worth it. Employees sneezing on Apple pies whipping hands on seat of pants. The new management is not any better. They where dumb to buy this one. If you have enough room to install two toilets then install two toilets! don't be ghetto and only have only one!
7223,16,8 months ago,5 stars,The girl taking my order at the counter had a few suggestions on ordering that saved us some money.
7224,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Do not park in their lot even if you are eating there.

The ""parking enforcement"" put a boot on my car after I ate here and refused to take it off unless I paid $75. I told him I just ate here and he told me the ATM was inside, seriously?

Not to mention that the lobby was littered with food waste, staff was rude, they didn't have ice cream or shakes and bathrooms were dirty.

0 stars if I could."
7225,16,7 years ago,1 star,"We were waiting in the drive thru on a Sunday morning. We were asked for our order only AFTER WE had said something about asking if our order was going to be taken and after having 5 other cars in the drive thru next to us  had gone. We started ordering and then the employee on the intercom said mid order ""hold on I'm helping a customer"" Um isn't that what you're supposed to be doing with us? I said screw it and drove off. You're in the customer service industry, I suggest learning some."
7226,16,5 years ago,3 stars,"I am not going to hold it too much against that them this particular store is in a part of town where there are a lot of homeless people. Any other restaurant in the same area would have the same struggles. Yes, there are a lot of homeless people in the parking lot and in the store, but there is nothing about this that is threatening to one's personal safety--I say this having gone here easily 100 times (my doctor thanks me). There is also an employee always in the parking lot or the store wearing a black shirt that says ""security"" in big white letters. What this person's actual background is in security is less certain--probably the entire training consists of putting on the shirt. The store is not as clean as one is used to with McDonald's franchises, and the drive-through service tends to be slower. I assume this is because they have a hard time keeping good help. Still, at the end of the day, I am impressed that the workers are generally courteous and the food is generally the same McD's consistency and quality, even with the particular challenges of being in this part of the city."
7227,16,4 years ago,3 stars,"Personally, I think the service was slow. The food was old, and not very good quality. The workers were nice and friendly but overall didn't seem to know what they were doing. I honestly do not like this location."
7228,16,5 years ago,1 star,"12:00 am  Wait 10 minutes behind the car in front of me.
12:10 am  Sever: Cash only, our system is down and rebooting.
Me: that's fine.
Sever: ok, what can we get for you.
Me: number one, medium with lemonade please.
Sever: hold on one moment
Me: ok?
Sever:
Me:
12:12. Me: hello?
12:15. Silence
12:20 Silence

That's when I left. One car was at the window, and at least 12 in line to order. It's always something here. No coffee at 6 am. Out of fries. Cash only. 30 minute wait with nothing to show for it. Super frustrating. If you are down to test your patience, give this location a shot."
7229,16,a year ago,1 star,"This particular store you never know when their lobby is open. Quick service, but they never abide by their posted hours"
7230,16,2 years ago,4 stars,Orders are always accurate and well made.  I haven't usually had to wait long at the drive thru.  They are not currently offering dine-in service.
7231,16,6 years ago,1 star,I pull up to drive thru and told to wait a moment. I wait 30 minutes to place order still nobody takes my order. I pull up to window thinking maybe I was forgotten. I honking horn employees looks at me and walks away. I stay there for another 15 minutes waiting and still nobody takes my order. And all the while I watch at least 12 other cars pull up to drive thru sit and wait and eventually leave cause nobody is taking orders. If your not going to do your job as an employee of McDonald's let the customers know so they don't have to wait  for nothing. By the way I had to give one star to post this. Other wise they would get -5 stars.
7232,16,a year ago,1 star,Customer service is horrible. Customer isn't right here. There correct and your wrong when they screw up an order
7233,16,5 years ago,2 stars,It was 3am when I went through the drive threw. I ordered a sausage mcgriddle 4 burritos 5 hash browns. Everything was hot except the mcgriddle. It was completely cold and I had to warm it up in my microwave when I got home. Then called the store and spoke with a manager about the situation.
7234,16,a year ago,1 star,"Just ordered 2 BigMacs, one with no lettuce.
Had NO sauce  the other had  a teaspoon worth on the edge of the burger.
Fries were meh."
7235,16,5 years ago,1 star,"This has got to be, hands down, one of the worst McDonald's restaurants around. Their service is downright abysmal. Also they are extremely high-priced. I do have to say that their food does live up to McDonald's standards. But by the time you fight off the homeless people, deal with the bad customer service, and pay exorbitant prices, this location just isn't worth it.  One other thing of note. This location does not honor the surveys for the buy one get one free."
7236,16,7 years ago,1 star,"I have never encountered a restaurant so rude before. We arrived there at 10:53 they close at 11, I know it's tabu to show up at a restaurant right before close, but we were 6 hours away from home and hungry. Not only were the doors already locked, but the three employees plus a security guard would not come to the door or even acknowledge we were there. Locking the doors early when your signs state your hours is unexceptable!!!!"
7237,16,8 years ago,1 star,"Had my car booted by 2 of the dumbest people I have ever met while my girl friend was buying a soda and I was buying wine for a lovely night.  There are 3 total signs displaying this premise, but 2 are on the opposite side of the lot and one is not reflective for their 7-10 night shift of booting/towing.  The signs also say people who aren't patrons will be booted, which I by extension was. My night was spent arguing with the employees and the tow company instead.  I recommend a wholehearted boycott."
7238,16,7 months ago,1 star,"This place always has the door lock, so you can not get in to the restaurant"
7239,16,4 years ago,1 star,"Extremely rude lady in the morning. I spoke to her with a smile and that did not deter her from the destain she showed, from what I assume because she had to serve me. Waaay too many other McDonald's around for me to need to deal with that in the morning.
If you see a short Asian lady with a grey uniform shirt, do not bother, she will just make your morning worse."

7241,16,4 years ago,1 star,"I would like to preface with the statement that I am a fairly hardcore proponent of the proletariat. With that said, the fact that they force you to utilize the kiosk must me some kind of self sabotage. If people are willing to pay at the counter then it could drive down demand for the kiosk.

Secondly; there is a heavyset woman with glasses that gets mad and angry when customers ask for stuff and has to forward it to the manager every time yelling loud enough for rhe lobby; not to mention she hovers over the lobby while people are eating (i get that you want to catch mess early or clean the tables quick I have worked food service before) but do not hover around people trying to eat like some kind of table patrol.

Fortunately the security guard is calm and collected. I mean generally if youre on the clock where else do you have to be?

Service is inconsistent, per the usual, horrible with Uber eats drivers and seem intent on the self destructive goal of ""sabotage my job""."
7242,16,2 years ago,2 stars,"Not gonna lie, my nuggets came kinda undercooked."
7243,16,2 years ago,1 star,Been waiting in a long line for the past 15 minutes. Pull up to the window to pay and the employee with the long blue fake nails is messing around on their phone watching YouTube. No wonder it was taking forever.
7244,16,7 years ago,1 star,"The place is disgusting in terms of cleanliness. Full of homeless people on heroin. We actually threw the food in the garbage after we paid for it.  It looked nasty and dangerously filthy. Parking lot outside is full of shady people checking out what is in your car. When we were leaving we saw about 15 people laying on the sidewalks totally stoned from some drug.
Wouldn't recommend (at all)."
7245,16,4 years ago,2 stars,"Tell me how I end up with a double cheese burger, whose patties, resemble a sloppy joe? My hamburger looked like they cleaned up the grill of all the pieces and threw them on a bun. But I got it quickly and my coke and fries were good so I gave them 2 stars."

7248,16,9 years ago,1 star,"The area is surrounded by homeless people so there is a strict 30-minute time limit on eating inside the restaurant. The bathrooms are locked and even asking multiple times to use one I was not given access. My fiance found some kind of blueish chunk in his burger and that ended it for us. Nice and clean but unfriendly staff and atmosphere, and frightening food."
7249,16,4 years ago,4 stars,Ok for fast food.  Parking lot and drive thru traffic makes the lot dangerous. Poorly designed. Usually always crowded.  The worst is when they ask you to pull up to #2 window to wait for your food and then they serve 5 cars behind you while you sit there and wait.
7250,16,4 years ago,1 star,"Awful place, ordered and ate my chicken tenders, fries and drink. Threw away the waste and sat back down to make a phone call. McDonald's ""security"" kicked me out. Said I couldn't stay more than 30 min. I was there 25 minutes and there was 5 other people in the restaurant. Horrible."
7251,16,5 years ago,1 star,This McDonalds forces customers to use the new machines. I couldn't order a large orange juice on my breakfast meal so I asked an employee for help. She didn't know how to order that from the machine either. She told me just order the small and that she would get me a large. While I'm waiting for my order another employee (I think it was the manager) told me I owed 50 cents for the large orange juice. She seemed annoyed with me and maybe the young girl too because we didn't know how to order the large OJ  I paid the 50 cents but was unhappy with how unfriendly and the whole experience was. I won't be back to this particular McDonalds.
7252,16,7 years ago,2 stars,I'm not sure what anyone who has lived in Utah expects when trying to dine in this area. It's pretty common knowledge that downtown is the heart of the homeless and many drug addicts. Not to mention this location is one block from pioneer park and very close to the road home/gateway area. I'm not excusing any rude or bad experiences but maybe just a bit more patience and compassion? It's fast food. Don't like the area? Dine elsewhere.
7253,16,3 years ago,1 star,"We go here after almost every late night event we attend in Salt Lake City. Concerts, Jazz games, Utes games. Will probably find another place. The Fries have been way below the McDonald's standard for the last few times and this last time, they changed their ice cream completely. Now the vanilla cones and the hot fudge sundaes are made with that cheap ""ice cream"" that is a cross between a terrible sorbet and cheap refrozen ice milk. Truly disgusting. At least the Cokes were $1.00...but that won't bring us back."
7254,16,3 years ago,2 stars,Its an average McDonalds. And i would have rated it 3 stars or higher. But there is always   A rude and sometimes and literate security guard who in morning doesn't speak any English the only English he does know is typed on his cellphone which he charmingly shows you if you don't buy something quick enough he says if you don't buy something get out then at night there's another security guard that isn't that much better he does speak English but again all he ever says is by something or leave
7255,16,4 years ago,4 stars,"Never had a problem here except my last order, we forgot our drinks in drive through and got someone else's order, which only fed my daughter, but I'm sure it was a simple mistake to make no fus over, besides i got cereal for dinner haha"
7256,16,5 years ago,1 star,No one to take your order just really confusing monitor that took twice as long.  Took forever to get food and c it was still messed up.  Only high point was watching the security guard kicking out a few prior one who dropped drugs on the way out.   Too bad the next closest McDonald's was under repair.  Drive thru only!!!
7257,16,2 years ago,1 star,"Like a box of chocolate you may get good service or terrible service. Out of the 5 times I have gone their over a 3 week span, I recieved decent service once. I recomend to avoid  this store"

7260,16,4 years ago,1 star,This McDonalds has really gone to **** ! The service? Ignored. After finally ordering? They don't take the time to bring you your order or even call out your damn number.

DONT VISIT THIS MCDONALDS

I waited for this lady to take my money for 5 minutes and all she did was look at me and took the drive thru orders. So I just pulled up to the other window to pay and it took another 4-5 minutes to friggin pay. Never again going to ANY McDonald's, ever."
7272,16,5 years ago,3 stars,"At this location, you can only use the order kiosks, not customer friendly. The employees will not take your order at the counter. I'm assuming due to the shady area this McDonald's is in? They didn't mess up my order at least."

The food quality was horrendous, and no apology was given for the long wait.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS.  Seriously, I don't expect gourmet food from Mcdonalds, but this was truly disgusting.  One english muffin was so hard my girlfriend nearly broke a tooth on it  My egg mcmuffin hadn't even been toasted.  The staff was unfriendly and unapologetic.  What a joke, we are greatly disappointed in this location."
7274,16,4 years ago,4 stars,"This location is always very busy. They are Fairly quick at serving people, but the lines are very long especially in the drive through. Staff never seems very friendly, maybe bc they see so many ppl?"
7275,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Grossest McDonald's I have ever been to. Dirty floors, like deep dirt gum looking black marks. But the worst part was the fly infestation! Flies all over the food prep area and the tables. Trying not to hurl while flies are landing on my head."
7276,16,a year ago,2 stars,They had one lane closed which is fine but the lane they had opened made everyone end up lining up in the street.
7277,16,2 years ago,4 stars,I got a quarter pounder with cheese no one is extra pickles and it was perfect. The fries were a little bit chilled and my son it was fine.
7278,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Super dirty McDonald's. Stopped to use washroom and the employee in the washroom was getting changed, hands all over stuff in there and just walked out without washing his hands. The same employee then walked out from behind the counter later and kicked some trash on the floor, didn't even react to it or bother to clean it up. Soda/Pop syrup dried all over the drink station with lids and straws in absolute disarray. Management here must be awful to allow this kind of behavior and terrible level of cleanliness."
7279,16,2 months ago,3 stars,Slow service and challenging communication

7281,16,4 years ago,1 star,"I just watched a vagrant peeing in a cup while eating my breakfast. He then dumped his piss cup out on the sidewalk. For God's sake ppl stop handing out money to hobos it just makes the issue worse. He wasn't even handicapped, yet he sat in a wheelchair. I watched him for an hour. When he didn't get any money from passing customers he stood up and walked away with his ""Help Please"" sign. This McDonalds is filled woth hobos often and I won't be back."
7282,16,2 years ago,5 stars,Got a dozen hot chocolates to go to take to the homeless youth center and they packaged them so they were so easy to carry. The youth appreciated them. Thanks!

7284,16,6 years ago,1 star,"Terrible drive thru. Super long wait, even at an odd time of day. Cold food, less than great service, and they handed me my drink half full, flat, and with the ice already melted."
7285,16,5 years ago,3 stars,"This is a good location with easy access off 5th south.  I like the new renovation which add 2 drive through lanes for faster service.

Overall a solid, typical McDonald's experience."
7286,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Honestly have never had a worse experience at a McDonald's. The order confirmation screen is broken, and the person taking orders apparently has not received training on reading back the order for accuracy. Three out of three times I have been to this location they have messed up something major on the order. The most recent time I got some serious attitude from the person taking orders. Spend a few extra minutes to another location or go to Burger King."
7287,16,2 years ago,2 stars,Customer service is less than impressive. Food quality was average. Longer than normal wait for basic food order.

7289,16,5 years ago,2 stars,"""Fast"" does not seem to be part of their vocabulary. I don't know if they changed management or what but they screw up orders, drive thru is slow & most of their employees are rude. It wasn't like this in the past."
7290,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Too anal about parking. Parked there because had to stops, McDonald's then the liquor store. Went to the liquor store first because didnt want our food to get cold waiting at the liquor store that was packed. Came back to drop off the bottle to go I to McDonald's and they booted my vehicle. Wasn't even parked there 5 minutes. ExplaiNed to the guy that I was going I to McDonald's as well,  he didn't care. He said I should have gone in McDonald's first. Umm then I still would have gotten the boot foe leaving my vehicle there.  No win situation. Well he took my last $25 that was my grandkids dinner money to unboot it. Can't return the liquor and couldn't buy them their dinner either. Thanks McDonald's parking enforcement. Real winners!"
7291,16,6 years ago,3 stars,"It's a McDonald's, what do you really expect? The location is pretty sketchy as downtown SLC is full of homeless people, many of whom use illegal drugs. But it looks clean enough, the fries are fresh, and the employees at the drive thu don't seem to completely despise their jobs.
Cheers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
7292,16,2 years ago,4 stars,This store was ok the employees could have been a lit nicer and at least act like they was some what thankful they had a job and the food showed how the employees where acting witch was ok but now good
7293,16,2 years ago,3 stars,Don't really like the area a lot of people starring at you while trying to get food because there waiting for work because they can't work legally in this state so they chill out at this McDonalds and home depot department store to try and find work every single day and it makes it a little uncomfortable. Cause they just stare at you anyone in the line at McDonald's.
7294,16,4 years ago,1 star,"I awoke one morning from a dream. Wiping the sweat from my brow, I tried to recall the details. ""Table service at MacDonald's"" I heard my self say aloud. I picked up my phone to find my dream a reality: MacDonald's had implemented technology allowing them to bring my order to me at the table. I could order on the kiosk, take a locator, and lo and behold, my order would appear before my very eyes. It was as if God himself had given me a glimpse of creation.

I sprung from my abode and ran on all fours to MacDonald's as quickly as possible, as if reality itself would evaporate before I got there. I arrived, breath short and mouth whet,   and began the final steps of my journey. My finger met the kiosk screen like lovers separated by the ocean reuniting.

I got my usual, a cheeseburger with no bun or patty, and sat patiently, gripping my locator  like the staff of Moses. The number seven sat abreast my locator -- the day God rested. ""I too would rest,"" I exclaimed aloud, ""when my journey meets it's end, as my food meets my table.""

But in the next instant, I was met with a fate worse than Gob's a thousand fold -- they called out my order from the counter and didn't bring it out to me.

My faith was shattered that day. Never again shall the thought of joy haunt my mind. Never again shall true happiness be known."
7295,16,2 years ago,1 star,"This ""cash orders only"" stuff is getting old. get better systems. No other fast food restaurant has to do this so there's no reason you should."
7296,16,5 years ago,1 star,I couldn't place an order with a person at this location so we walked out and went somewhere else and ate. The employees here needs to take a customer order instead of tell a person that they need to place an order at their self service machine. We will not be coming back to this location
7297,16,10 months ago,1 star,the worst place to go. that when the order was for my children and the answer was for me to leave because they were not going to attend to me
7298,16,3 years ago,2 stars,"Fries tasted stale, one of the ordered 10 piece nugget only had 9, they forgot Any of the two flavored sauces requested (2 of the 10 piece nuggets were in the order). Just not a great day to go to McD's I guess..."
7299,16,7 years ago,5 stars,"work here... Most dont know but we have a new store manager and I hope this manager keeps everything more organized. What most people don't know is that the other manager never put the effort needed for the store, therefore most slacked off... I've worked here about 3 to 4 months and like it so far, but some managers aren't the nicest... me, I've been working for Mc'Donalds for about a year, I come in everyday with a smile on my face no matter how bad my day is. I read these reports and think "" these bad employees/managers make not only themselves look bad but me too! I will continue to have great customer service, most people get mad we take too long... the Damn store has broken appliences every week... yeah they should replace it, but won't, just keep repairing it till its done... anyways point being, very disappointing knowing we still get a bad review when I try hard to make everyone happy. Thank All y'all -Javier Elizondo"

7304,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Pretty awful. No human interaction, kiosks not super intuitive, paying cash... waited 10( a while, maybe not 10)minutes at a register to pay cash. Will go to Wendy's instead. Dirty tables and a homeless looking person helping customers on the self serve kiosks"
7305,16,6 years ago,1 star,Consistently the worst McDonald's I've ever been too. I quit going here. Even late at night they make you wait forever in the drive thru. You're better off going to the Wendy on the other side of the block
7306,16,4 years ago,3 stars,Hey it's McDonald's what can you say LOL we already know we're not paying for service they've even lowered their standards and don't even care the manager there is this guy named Rodger he thinks he's super funny he's always making jokes when you roll up to the window problem is his jokes are rude he means well but half of the time he scares my kids. But hey you want the cheapest cheeseburger on the block they got it.
7307,16,6 years ago,1 star,"Probably the slowest employees in McDonalds history. This definitely is NOT ""Fast Food"",  the lobby is always dirty and seems to be filled with drug addicts (in part just due to the area). Dont bring your kids here for a Happy Meal."

No pickles or onions, just cheese, a hamburger patti, and ozing grease. Worse burger I've ever had and I will never have another"
7311,16,4 years ago,1 star,Showed up went inside was waiting for friend to get off phone with his father in hospital to see what he wanted to eat. Security decides I'm just a nuisance. Time taken to occur 4 minutes 35 seconds
7312,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Is this Mcdonalds or some strange car booting  entity governed by sketchy  people?   Very strange booting  practices.  They film you leaving your car, yet say nothing. The sign is too high and barely visible. They basically  boot your car for not going straight to  McDonald's .

I left to get a wine then grab something from Mcdonalds as well since i was hungry. However, on my way to  liquor store an old man told me to go back grab my car since it will be booted. It already had been booteed ONLY 3-4 mins later when i ran back.

They wouldn't take it off so i kept complaining. Hey said  i should eaither pay $75  now, or $250 after it's towed .

This is a disgusting practice in a first world country."

7314,16,4 years ago,1 star,A racist appalling and unacceptable behavior by the security and employees occurred today at this McDonalds. My friend suffered a racist attack by some other white customer who asked the security to have them take my friend who is Hispanic out of the restaurant simply because of the white customers request. This is shocking and disturbing behavior and needs to be remedied and addressed immediately. This restaurant will suffer lawsuits very soon.
7315,16,4 years ago,1 star,Loud and crowded.  Table was uneven and whobbley.  Horrible place for a date weekend evening.  Server kept coming and asking if we were ready to order every couple minutes.  Felt rushed.
7316,16,6 years ago,1 star,"If you wanna wait 15 minutes in the drive thru line to be told cash only.... literally happens every time. Have never had a quick, positive experience here and I live down the street. Go to another location and don't waste your time. Such. A. Joke."

7321,16,6 years ago,1 star,The 15 minute wait time in the drive thru is no joke! Management does not care. At least the Homeless dude made some $$ panhandling from all of the waiting cars! Avoid the gridlock!

7326,16,7 years ago,1 star,"This Mcdonalds needs new management. Every time I have been there the manager not the employees screw something up on my order. The managers are very rude and dont have a problem using swear words to try and get their point accross. Just from what I have seen that store would be better off with no managers than the ones they have now, they might even show a profit. I have stopped going to this Mcdondalds and will never go back even though they are only blocks for my work."

7336,16,4 years ago,2 stars,The cashier doesn't know too much about 'Mobile Order' system causing a lot of time waisted. Everything else is ok. Except that some customers were frustrated about the new self-ordering displays in the store. Apparently not for all.
7337,16,5 years ago,1 star,This mcdonalds is a heinous cancer on society. They will boot your car if you are there longer than thirty minutes or they assume that you did not eat there. there was a guy hanging out accros the street filming people parking. He had us on camera going into the mcdonalds we had a receipt and he still put a boot on our car. After arguing with him and going over footage and receipts he finally admitted his mistake. What an atrocious piece of garbage company. This experience is the last straw for a sub par fast food restaurant. I'm done with mcdonalds there's plenty of other sub par restaurant that don't boot paying customers cars.

Then when I tried to call, the phone wouldn't work. Finally when I walked back they acted like it was my fault because I ""forgot"" the other bag that they didn't bring out when the called my order. Terrible place."

7342,16,5 years ago,4 stars,Makes good chocolate chip frappes and orders are usually correct. Sometimes the people that take your order through the mic in the drive through are uncaring and depressing and sometimes they are friendly
7343,16,5 years ago,1 star,"Always seems to be a problem when we go at night after hours like between 12a -4a. Be it a system failure,  stock depletion,  etc.  Also the employees are hardly ever happy or cordial in doing their job"

7351,16,4 years ago,3 stars,Store was clean and meat in appearance. The new order kiosks are a hit and miss and can be confusing as many people did not know how to work them. McDonald's should ditch the kiosk and go back to the face to face service they had for years. Food was ok for McDonalds

7375,16,8 years ago,1 star,"Purchased a soda at this McDonalds and walked next door for LITERALLY 5 minutes, came back and had a boot on my car! Apparently, CUSTOMER or NOT if you step off the property the owner of this McDonalds has an agreement with a private company to boot your car! I wont even get started on the ample supply of bums sitting around the property. THIS IS THE WORST SCAM I HAVE EVER HAD DONE ON ME. This McDonalds probably makes a profit off the tickets they spend the day issuing its customers. I will never again visit a downtown McDonalds!!!"

Oh, and, for what it's worth, milk is actually cheaper than cream  (well, cow's milk, anyway...not sure about camel milk or elephant milk.)"

7419,16,5 years ago,5 stars,Though there may be a wait at times the staff here are friendly and take that extra moment to make sure everything is made right. I can tell that it's a very stressful job so I respect those willing to make my food for me when I don't want to do it myself.

7442,16,a year ago,1 star,"Not a 24-hour location. If you're not running a 24-hour business, then make you advertise your open and close times accurately."
7443,16,6 years ago,3 stars,The service is fast and what you'd expect from McDonalds.  The only frustration is the traffic at this intersection.  It can be tricky to get in and out of depending on the direction you're traveling.
7444,16,2 years ago,4 stars,Customer service was in okay I wish I spoke a little Spanish it would have been better if you know what I'm saying

7453,16,4 years ago,2 stars,Their free WiFi unfortunately does not work properly at this location at this time. That should probably be maintained pretty soon.
7454,16,11 months ago,5 stars,The only draw back was that their dine in closes at 8pm
7455,16,a year ago,1 star,They should probably update their signs so that we know the times they're actually open.
7456,16,5 years ago,3 stars,Really strange because of giant touch screen ordering stations. There's a guy that directs you to them. The stations are slow to respond to touch and generally slow to use. Just hire some darn cashiers...
7457,16,6 years ago,2 stars,Homeless people will ask for money in the parking lot. The restroom has always had a dirty homeless guy washing himself or in the toilet stall  EVERYTIME that I have used it.

7466,16,5 years ago,1 star,They should probably prepare for the midnight and after rush that they seem to get EVERY night.  It can't be a surprise.  5 minutes waiting just to order!
7467,16,5 years ago,1 star,Honestly worst McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s drive thru in salt lake. Whether itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

7473,16,4 years ago,4 stars,Clean and the staff was awesome. Food got to us quick... Note to customers the Restrooms lock

7475,16,5 years ago,5 stars,The Big-Mac is better than ever.  And the Junior Mac is great. You gotta love it.  Food is consistent at the 90th South location.
7476,16,7 years ago,4 stars,They've made some improvements.  The help is friendly.  You still have to keep an eye on your vehicle though.

I love the relatively reasonable prices (not sure why a double cheeseburger is on the $1 menu but the single hamburger is almost twice the price or why a small fries is $2.49), but they allowed me to pay what I usually pay for lunch at Panera  and not only feed myself (a hamburger) but get the homeless and disabled person asking for money outside the front door a meal that he asked for (a double cheeseburger and a slushie) when I didn't have any cash."

7826,15,3 years ago,4 stars,"From a quick visit about 4 months ago:

Dining room was small, seemed clean (my order was to-go so didn't spend much time inside).

Loved the digital menu/self-order kiosks (ordered at the kiosk and it still gave the option to pay cash at the register, though not sure if that option's still available and/or if the dining room's even open right now...?).

Staff was friendly enough and very helpful, packed my to-go order like absolute pros.

The area where the fountain drinks, straws, etc., are wasn't super tidy (a bit of a spill on the countertop, if memory serves); however, seemed clean, otherwise.

Because it was such a quick trip, didn't get to see the condition of the bathrooms (a good indicator of an establishment's working and overall conditions, in my experience). Maybe another time?

Overall, a good experience.

Something to consider: there's no drive-through nor a parking lot and finding a parking space seems to be a nightmare/hit-or-miss in that area. Circled the surrounding blocks a few times before someone parked almost right in front of the store just happened to be leaving (not sure how often that happens, though). Score!

The previous parking spot I'd found was about 2 blocks away (doable), but kept searching in order to be closer to the other establishment my group and I were visiting prior to McD's."

If you want your kids to run free and havd fun this is as good as option as there is here. They tend to have a lot of private events on weekends, but the restaurant nonetheless remains open to the public."
7835,15,4 years ago,1 star,Every two seconds the door flings open with another customer and you freeze to this cold weather. On top of that the bathrooms require a token to be inserted and can  be obtained by anyone at the registers free of charge. Meanwhile there are fully unlocked and working bathrooms on the second floor that everyone can use. The worse part was that the entire staff was Mexican and did not speak one word of English to each other. As a matter of fact they were laughing and having a great time in their own language while taking my order which is extremely rude to me and to other customers.
7836,15,3 years ago,1 star,"This place is newly renovated, but it is not spacious. The new touch screens for placing orders are the reason for this. The new seating is cramped as well. I placed my order with the cashier and she could barely understand plain English...probably why the touch screens are there. I'm not coming back to this McDonald's."

Like all Mickey D's, the fries are only good for about 7 minutes before they're cold and soggy. Shovel it all in before it all feels gross."
7852,15,4 years ago,3 stars,Great French fries but that as always depends mostly on when they last changed their fry oil. The nuggets had been sitting in their hot tray for too long and were dried out and looked like the had also been over cooked good friendly staff though
7853,15,6 years ago,3 stars,"This place provides food like all other McDonald's does but is one of those that is untidy. Garbage is not picked up even when it's already full. And the restrooms need tokens to open which makes this experience so unpleasant.

Now,  they are making their quarter pounders fresh when ordered so you may have a slight wait.  But I'm sure it won't take that long.  I ordered the fish sandwich which is just okay. I wish they'd make it bigger and not skimp on the slice of cheese. I like their $1, $2, and $3 menu. The fries were fresh but don't come close to wonderful fries served at the BK Lounge. Take notice though king, McDonald's is open 24 hours. I'd take their fries any day at 3AM vs. No fries from the closed Burger King near my house."
7859,15,7 years ago,3 stars,"Customer service wasn't great. I wasn't welcomed and the worker didnt seem like she cared I was there. I only got a 20 piece, I got it in a minute. They tasted a tad bit off than the usual nuggets so i didnt enjoy it as much. The place was clean."
7860,15,4 years ago,1 star,"Filthy environment,  broken booths, and bathroom required a token .  Staff was unable to correctly fill my order for three beverages.

7862,15,4 years ago,3 stars,It is a weird experience. The food is really good but the service is horrible. The place is dirty. The customer cant get a tray after a certain time. The problem is all the tables are dirty which makes it even more frustrating.

7866,15,5 years ago,1 star,"I used the McD's mobile app for the first time. There was a ""deal"" available through the McD's app that was a great value & fit what I enjoy at McD's (occaisionally). Everything processed for the order... once I succeeded in completing the order with small amount of difficulty. Checked my account two days later as part of semi-weekly review. The McD's mobile ordering double charged me for the order. They processed two charges for the one order. When rhe corporate McD's was contacted they apologized, stated the program has occasional quirks (being worked out), and told me I needed to drive out of my way to go back to the store to get my money back. After explaining that they would have to reimburse my time and expenses to do their legwork in correcting their error of stealing my money AND explaining that they simply review their detail processing report of electronic charges for the two transactions (I provided the actual transaction info for date, time, #'s etc) they agreed to process the charge reversal.... because they WOULD NOT reimburse my time/expenses to return to get my refund of money they stole out of my account. After considerable time and insistence on my part, the manager agreed and reviewed the transactions report, verified the double billing, and assured the charge will be reversed. I got a follow up call from the area manager for McD's who turned out to be VERY unprofessional and rude in her attitude and handling if the matter. She actually admitted she hung up on me when I was reprimanding her on her shortcomings for not listening to what I was saying and continually speaking loudly over me, while I was speaking. Interesting..... is this how McD's is improving the bottom line, by stealing? NO ONE at McD's, even after explaining the process to correct an improper charge, had a clue how to address or willingness to pursue. They directly stated it was on me. I had to come back to a store, out of my way, to get a refund of my money, that they improperly seized from my account. Unbelievable as that is for my 1st mobile order/purchase experience w/McD's they were excited I used it and recommended I try the mobile order system again soon. Yeah right..... I'm gonna use a system with a 100% failure rate (my experience) and that they have no knowledge of how to process system failures, that do occur to their admission & knowledge. Horrible experience in all regards. Clearly rolled out the program with known links and poor or no training in corrective measures when incurred."

7874,15,5 years ago,2 stars,"For one usually it's only for coffee and to get away from the office as I stopped eating McDonald's food. The problem I faced recently was a homeless person who walked up to me and asked for 2 dollars for bus fare. When the bus stop is like 2 to three blocks down the road. I said I will buy you something to eat or drink but not give money. So,  for folks or tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money I suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money. One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find. Food too they know where to go. It's up to them to make that move. Another major situation I noticed is the McDonald's need some updating. I might know why they keep it so dull looking because McDonald's operates with the homeless so I guess they don't want to make it too comfortable. I been to much better ones who got nice and cool lounge chairs couches and OMG this one just looks ragged."

7893,15,4 years ago,4 stars,"The foods greatly improved in flavor and price with the new 1,2,3 menu but if there is a Wendy's nearby you should go to that instead."

7909,15,5 years ago,2 stars,I'd say a below average McDonald's. Very dirty and lots of homeless on weekends I've been here. No friendly workers here which is a McDonald's usual but you do generally get what you order somewhat quickly. It is probably as cheap as you'll get in the area.

7920,15,5 years ago,3 stars,"The cheapest meal I had on my trip to DC...

Not the cleanest McDonald's I've ever been in and they often allowed panhandlers to sit literally infront of their front doors, but it served to provide cheap breakfast before the task of tracking into the National Mall each day."

8253,15,4 years ago,4 stars,"Not very good attention from the employees of the place. One of the employees who was serving me spoke to me in a way that was not very well seen on my part. When I got there, she looked like I was a beggar, because I was working and decided to go eat. However, the employee said as ""yes, what will you want!"" No! No! No! But in a disgusting way. But I ignored him and left the place. In addition, the restaurant has a second floor for those who are not in a hurry to go for lunch, breakfast or whatever. There is something very good about this place is that there are staff who speak Spanish and English. This place is also extremely close to the Honduran Embassy. I recommend this place."

The furniture probably has not changed since the opening of the first institution (1948), apparently the dress code does not apply here.

8368,10,4 months ago,2 stars,"This is my first ever 2 star review.
I stopped in for a quick bit, or so I thought. I had no issue with the food or the face that there was a wait. What I had an issue with was the one male working the counter was more interested in flirting with the girl with pink hair working the fry machine that he had customers waiting for him to stop talking to her just to get them items he left off their order. At one time I was able to finally get the pink haired girls attention and I told her I was missing a coke. She told him and he went on flirting. I finally got his attention and told him I still needed my coke and he turned around and asked someone else to get it and went right back to his flirting. I do not think that his actions or lack there of reflects the overall workers at this location, but at the end of the day his actions are reflected in the review ratings that myself and others have given. The food is great, certain staff at this location not so much."
8369,10,2 months ago,2 stars,Busy loud dirty disgusting. The food was mediocre at best the restaurant was filthy employees were over stressed and understaffed so I really couldn't communicate with them. I had an issue with a deal on the app and was not being allowed to use it appropriately but ended up having to pay a higher price anyway because I couldn't relate my issue to the manager without stalling line and making people wait longer.
8370,10,3 months ago,1 star,"The worst McDonald's I've ever seen. The service is incredibly unpleasant and unwilling. You enter a locator at the kiosk, but you still have to go to the counter for your order. Find out they haven't a cappuccino. You ask what others can they offer you - without an answer. You talk about coffee with milk and you get something disgusting that doesn't even remotely resemble coffee. Without apology, with unpleasant looks and even with a rude comment among the employees. Terrible customer service."
8371,10,5 months ago,1 star,"You have never experienced a food establishment like this one before. Probably because they've all been shut down. I've been reluctantly stopping in this place while shopping in Macy's for many many years and it's the same experience everytime. At this point, I do it for the entertainment. The kiosk and ordering setup is a recipe for disaster, just for starters. But you will usually wait 30-45 minutes just to be told that all the food and everything you ordered is sold out. If you're lucky enough to get your food, and it seems edible, there's 0% chance the dining room will be open. With all that said, it's not even the worst part. The staff are the craziest, rudest, nastiest human beings you will ever experience. They have zero filter. They scream and curse at eachother and the customers. One time I got yelled at for asking for sweet and sour sauce and they then proceeded to gather and talk about me asking for sweet and sour sauce, as if there's something wrong with that. After ignoring the request I asked again and she made an over exaggerated movement while rolling her eyes and putting her hand out, telling me it was $1. For 1 sauce. It was the best entertainment I've ever received for the money."
8372,10,5 months ago,1 star,"Beware this location.
I am a huge user of Mcdonald Happy Meal for my child so I know how to use a Mcdonald app order but this location is not working at all. Furthermore, the kiosk order system just takes the money from the credit card.(receipt paper was run out) even the person register took my order twice for one happy meal.
I paid 4 times for one happy meal. I understand this place is overcrowded in the Macy's department but they can work better. I won't go back to this location ever. Worst place ever."

8388,10,a year ago,1 star,"I only gave a 1 because I have to. By far the worst serviced, dirtiest, and had the most amount of rude, ignorant employees including the manager. Have been to McDonald's all over the US and several other countries and this by far the worst I ever seen or been in.
Food- 0 of 10 (cold, didn't give whole order, gave drinks that were sitting there with ice melting on a counter)
Service-0 of 10 (did kiosk order, and waited 29 minutes for my order after being told by 1 employee my number wasn't ready as it sat there and I saw it. Manager looked at me/over me 3x before asking me what number I was. Then a lady came from the back of the kitchen and helped me as best she could.
Will specifically tell people not to go here when they travel during the holidays. Its a shame this place isn't kept up with like the rest of the macys store and stores around it."

I showed up at least 2 hours before the publicly posted closing time, and 30 minutes before the closing time verbally expressed by the cashier. Still, they only had fountain drinks, old coffee, stale mcnuggets, and ONE stale fish filet available. They had decided to clean all equipment and stop making food well before closing. Macy's is a long-respected New York institution. This lackluster and poorly run franchise is a detriment to a great store."

8394,10,7 years ago,1 star,"The only reason I give this place a one is because there isn't a 0 option this is the WORST McDonald's I've ever been to.  The staff is RUDE.  We had to wait 20 minutes to order when there wasn't anyone else in line.  Couldn't use the bathroom until we showed a receipt and then there was no toilet paper.  A worker brought paper towels up,  said there was no toilet paper and let his girlfriend jump in line in front of me to use the bathroom. Couldn't even get in the men's bathroom the door was locked and you couldn't get in there.  Told the staff about it and they could care less I've never been treated so poorly.  The guy that was guarding the stairs to the bathroom was a poor excuse for an employee and McDonald's is wasting their money on paying someone to treat customers poorly."

So never come back!"

They refused to SELL ice water to us.

I have never been to a McDonalds that REFUSES to SELL ice water. (It's usually free)

Also, the lady who took our order could barely understand English and had to ask another employee to translate for her. We ended up repeating our order three times.

This is probably the worst service I have ever had at McDonalds."

They treat every one that comes in as an addict or criminal. All the tables are filthy. Hispanic security guard on Wednesday night at end of shift, addressed me as mammy, when I told him that comment was inappropriate, he cursed me out, and commented that I was old enough to be his mother .... not sure how this may have made it appropriate in his head. In addition I doubt very much that statement was true... while he was talking thus... he was also changing his sneakers in the disgustingly dirty dining area. The security guard replacing him, was changing his clothes in plain sight as well... The bathrooms have broken doors, stalls are anything but private.

I picked up the scrabler eggs and litterly could not shake them apart. The biscuit was colder than the weather outside. When I asked for fresh food then the managers get mad at me. This place sucks. Macy employees should boycott this place. The only reason I gave 1 star, there's not anything lower."

The only thing is when I went to redeem a discount I had from a different branch they stonewalled me and said they had a different one and can't accept mine. Slightly disappointed.

Children become stunted."

8413,10,3 years ago,1 star,The workers do not wear gloves nor hair nets. The setting is very unprofessional. Workers were texting and having inappropriate conversations. Poor customer service and long wait time for food.
8414,10,10 years ago,3 stars,Located on the 7th floor of Macy's. This McDonald's is a mad house! Very large crowd filled with children who want to steal your happy meal toy. We went here out of convenience but it was nothing special. Just a McDonald's oddly placed in Macys. Gotta love the chicken mcnuggets though!
8415,10,5 years ago,1 star,This Macdonald's is a joke. Late again . I'm an employee of Macy's and 4 out of 5 times a week they open late. And the food is not worth it. 1 st class JOKE . Would give 0 stars.

The clerk taking your order is always impatient as if they have something way better to do than assist you, and to top it off the dining hours end at 5pm so if you're not driving through drive thru, tough luck.. save your money and go to another local McDonald's or the Farmer Boys less than a block away."
8487,31,a year ago,4 stars,"The difference in taste of the meat from the Big Mac to the quarter pounder was astronomical. Like it didn't even come from the same type of animal! So will not be doing the Big Mac again. They were fast and they were friendly, but still McDonald's."

It's a dangers spot, especially at night. I hope the corporate office does something about it. Homeless guy was cleaning the windshield of a car that litterly on the drive through and he was at next to the window while he was cleaning the windshield. Employee never said a word to the homeless.

I showed her my order and she still refused. She said I should cancel it. When I asked how she said she didn't know how. Horrible service
8492,31,a year ago,1 star,Way over priced. They recycle their fries now because every time I go to one of these places the fries are cold and chewy. The double cheeseburgers taste as though they were microwaved. I don't know I think they're trying to save money or something but it's not going to work for me anymore. Especially at the sky high prices. Sorry no can do

8494,31,a year ago,1 star,The inside is always closed and never open the drive-thru line is always long and they do not provide a sign saying that the inside of the restaurant is closed but we're paying $15 for a meal.... They also had an employee that was sitting in there I tapped on the window to ask her where they open she rode her eyes and turned her head people should do that when they're at work ï¿½ï

My gosh they have got it all. Oh yeah, they have French fries, too! And milkshakes which taste exactly like McDonald's milkshakes. I expected that they would but you know it's always nice when things go according to plan. In conclusion, if you are ever in the mood for McDonald's food, then this location will fulfill that need A+!"

The last two times I've been here including tonight they gave me a diet Coke. I know I need to diet and not drink so much sugar for my diabeters, but I didn't ask for a Diet Coke. The first instance they didn't bother to read back my order or verify at the window. This time they verified my order but left out the medium fries which was no big deal, but screwing up the Coke after ï¿½ï"
8505,31,a year ago,4 stars,It's not your typical McDonald's. They're over price on their menu plus they do not accept coupon or does any special like regular McDonald's. I think they feel the need to make their money from the Disneyland patron and it's ridiculous toward the regular customer's but it's all boil down to make money. Sometimes they can be rude toward the black customer but what to expect from seeing who goes into this franchise. Most of the customer that goes into this store are traveller which is mostly Caucasian

8507,31,11 months ago,1 star,I'm a McDonalds fan boy and this McDonalds is my least favorite in Los Angeles if not the entire United States. It used to be average/ middle of the road as far as MCD goes but recently it's tanked and I wouldn't suggest going here anymore. I'd rather eat at the McDonalds in the airport.
8508,31,2 years ago,1 star,Hate having to come to this place the staff is quick but they allow people to aggressively beg for money food anything they can say the drive thru sign and all throughout the parking lot of you don't roll down your window which u have to eventually bc is a drive thru. They will come to your car and they will knock on your window as is you might not be able to hear them or know they are there already should not be allowed.   At all

8512,31,a year ago,1 star,Horrible place bad service. I ordered at 3:40am didn't get my order until 4:13 I was missing half my order and when I told them they had the nerve to say they will replace it for breakfast items because they no longer serve lunch. It's not my fault they can't do their job correct and get orders right!
8513,31,5 years ago,4 stars,"If you are visiting this particular McDonald's you'll notice that you are very nearly in the middle of the strange no-man's (or woman's) land encompassing skid row and the new upwardly trendy lofts and shops that seek to define Download Los Angeles. This McDonald's manages to straddle this uncomfortable melange quite nicely. The inside of the restaurant was bright and clean. The counters looked new and the menu sign actually was orderly laid out with sensible photos next to the main items. I don't eat fast food often and the overhead menus always confuse me with ""super"" this and ""extra large"" that... I know that I am not getting the best price - ever. But this menu seemed far simpler, we ordered and our food was served quickly (with my special request done just right). We ate in and the table was clean as was the floor. It's true we were approached twice by people asking for money, but they were not intrusive and I had the feeling the manager and staff were well aware of who was in the restaurant and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. The staff was so attentive that for the first time I actually filled out the online survey just to compliment them. That's quite a compliment in itself coming from me."
8514,31,a year ago,4 stars,"It's a nice place, I have not dined in. But even when the line looks long during the morning I can honestly say that they provide a faster service to get you out ASAP!!"

I gave them back all the happy meals and asked for new ones with toys, fries were not salted at all I could see the fry guy trying to fill the salt shaker and could not. A manager had to fill it and they never did salt them."

8517,31,3 years ago,3 stars,I had a bad experience here.  My son who is autistic had to use the restroom really bad.  He bolted in the women's restroom when a lady came out.  I was confronted by the security guard in an angry manner.  He said I had to buy something before using the restroom and said my son couldn't use the women's bathroom. I attempted to explain to him that my son is special needs and did not understand the symbols on the restroom door.  He argued with me and wouldn't shut his mouth.  Before I left I  bought a meal for each member of my family.  While waiting for our meal he stared at me like if he wanted some trouble.  I explained to him that it's frustrating when people can't see the situation parents with special needs go through.  I apologized to him for getting angry and made him aware of the treatment we get at some establishments.  Hopefully he learned a little about how to understand and deal with certain situations.

8522,31,2 years ago,1 star,I'm catching the Greyhound across the street and can't order breakfast until 9 a.m. This is ludicrous.  Now I'm not sure when I'll be able to eat again.

The only problem with this particular McDonald's is the homeless population which of is no fault of McDonald's but you just have to be alert when going through the drive thru or dining in this location it can be quite dangerous at times the pan handlers can be very aggressive at times and confrontational. So beware if you come to this location."

8541,31,5 years ago,1 star,"TERRIBLE service. Stopped by this place 3 times at about 1am hour. First time the lady messed up my order so bad and when I asked her to correct it she still got it wrong. But hey...it was 1am I get it. Nope...came back a week later and this time the drive thru person couldn't understand English at all. I tried and tried to get her to understand my order and nothing. I have no problems with the language barrier but this was just unacceptable for a window worker. Third time was tonight. Got here early this time - they close at 9pm. It was 8:30 and doors were already locked inside and out. The worker just stood their ignoring everyone even though they are supposed to close 30 min from now.

In summary
1- untrained workers who either cant speak English/dont pay attention to orders
2- service takes FOREVER
3- lazy and disorganized workers who close way too early.

Avoid this place!!!"

Active on site security inside the establishment. I felt like I was being scrutinized. I assume shady things go on here. #2. I found out this McDonalds is located in an area called skid row. #3. The price of the food here is above the average price of the rest of the united states of america. #4. There isn't really a lot of friendly interaction between the clerk and the guest as well. For the most part this is what I gathered from this place. Taking into account that it was the first and only time I've been there. Not a good representation for Los Angeles for it being so close to the Greyhound bus station portal. If its any consolation , I received my food hot and it was good."

They are very rude and never plesejt nor fonthey saybtyank you or have manora what so ever. I was flat out refused service one time because I walked to this place and needed to go through the drive through.
I have a perfectly working car but use that time to exercise by walking down there.
I'm also asked at least twice before and twice after I get my food for money every single time I to there by people asking for a hand outs. Its very uncomfortable. That is not an exaggeration either. Can't the security who work there try protecting your customers from being harassed instead of being on their cell phone all the time?
You guys are literally my last option when it comes to getting some thing to eat around where I live because of how uncomfortable it is to go there. There's a lot of people who avoid this place for those reasons too. I'm defiantly not the only one."
8571,31,3 years ago,4 stars,They was nice but no more $1.00 food on the menu I was not very happy about this with me living on a goverment check so I don't have to much money when I was told that they stoped the dollar menu so with me not having to much money I got some thing to eat no I wouldn't go back to no McDonald's because of no more dollar menu I will be going to like Burger King they have a dollar menu or Jack In The Box the meal are a lot cheaper than McDonald's I think they lost their minds not having the dollar menu no more other than that they was very nice because I'm in a power wheelchair
8572,31,5 years ago,4 stars,I've never actually gone inside this location but I use the drive thru fairly regularly. It's a pretty busy spot but even before they put in the dual-lane ordering system the service was always quick.
8573,31,5 years ago,1 star,"The absolute worst McDonald's I've ever been to. And I'm not one to complain. Every time I've been through the drive-thru, I've had to wait nearly 30 minutes for my food. And every time I'm speaking into the drive thru window, the person taking my order needs to repeat my order to me several times due to the language barrier. On top of that, I attempted to go eat in-store about 20 minutes ago and found that the lobby was already closed. The lobby was not to be closed until 9 p.m., and they closed it about 30 minutes prior. I have not had any positive experiences at this particular McDonalds. Corporate needs to do something about this location."
8574,31,4 years ago,1 star,"Worst service ever. Took 35 minutes to get through the drive through and both window 1 guy & window 2 girl gave me attitude. Window 1 couldn't get my order right and their drive through screen didn't display my simple order. And then Window 2 lady gave me the wrong sauce EVEN AFTER CONFIRMING WHAT I ASKED FOR WITH HER! Fire all of them, shut down this location, and board up the building. Do it now."
8575,31,4 years ago,2 stars,Drive thru service is always slow at this location.  I paid for my order at 645am (and i know because i have my receipt) but i got my food at 703am (and this i know because i had to return a juice at 704am and i have a receipt for that as well)... 20 minutes of wait aside from the extra time i had to wait in line to get to the order speaker and then to the paying window. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  the only reason i waited is because i like to leave
8576,31,7 years ago,2 stars,Homeless fighting in parking lot and harassing customers for money. Dining area is messy and dirty. It took 15 minutes to get my order. A worker was behind the counter eating ice cream cone dripping it all over the place and herself
8577,31,3 years ago,1 star,They got my whole order wrong even after we corrected them they still purposely messed up the order leaving out some ingredients. One of the employees told me that everyone was mad because they have to go to another store to pick up their checks. Donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï
8578,31,a year ago,5 stars,Food is always hot the servi  ce is good never had to complain been going there for years
8579,31,a year ago,4 stars,"Had the mcdonald's egg, sausage cheese meal, along with my girlfriend for a quick breakfast before heading home from L.A to San jose, it hit the spot since i was in a hurry!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
8580,31,3 years ago,4 stars,They order for you on the touch screen if theyre busy. The only McDonald's I tried where their hash brown didnt come out hot and fresh! Very disappointed and will not order breakfast at this location!
8581,31,4 years ago,3 stars,"It's ok. Not the fastest, no play area, not the best neighborhood, lots of loitering, but drive through is open late and is generally quick, and often accurate."
8582,31,4 years ago,1 star,"If I could I wouldn't even give one star to this location , employees are very rude and disrespectful. I dont understand how they get away by not getting discipline .
They need a huge training on customers satisfaction skills .otherwise they should look for a different kind of work where they dont have to be seen to avoid their behavioral issues at the workplace"
8583,31,10 months ago,1 star,Homeless people harass you while at the drive thru to buy them food. Very sad situation.
8584,31,9 months ago,4 stars,They cool no handle picking up from they me.
8585,31,4 years ago,1 star,"Every time I go to this McDonalds near me they are rude and never smile. I don't mind so much but once in a while would be nice. It's the first place I came to eat once I moved here which wasn't a good sign and completely turned me off from a place I used to love to come to eat at.
Plus the homeless situation is out of control here. How about the security Dallas get off their phone and do their job? I literally haven't gone since in weeks because I'm asked for either a smoke, money or food every single time I go through drive-through. I'm sorry but I can't be buying someone else food everytime I go here. I just can't afford it."
8586,31,4 years ago,4 stars,Stopped for a quick meal in between bus stops.  They provided quick service and thankfully no errors on the food order.  Appreciated that the diner was relatively clean.
8587,31,5 years ago,4 stars,I tried curbside delivery using the McDonald's app and it worked. The only problem is that there are only 2 delivery spots and regular eat-in customers park in them. That defeats the purpose. Inside the place was clean and there are 2 self-service ordering kiosks.
8588,31,a year ago,3 stars,Everytime I go there the orders are always mixed up. But it's ok
8589,31,5 years ago,1 star,"Gosh the ""manager"" Claudia has a nasty ghetto attitude. She has no idea of what leave your problems at home is. I had order a quarter pounder combo and the cashier charged me wrong. when i pull to the second window of the drive through she said W/ATTITUDE ""YOU OWE ME"" 5 something. I asked why was she screaming and been rude and she kept talking giving attitude to me and immediately took it after the 1st cashier. Wow.. Coming to this spot NEVER AGAIN. I should of gone to Urth yet so close.. smh.."
8590,31,5 years ago,4 stars,Great service. The only reason it is 4 and not 5 ia because of the homeless people who are never satisfied. If you give them a dollar they ask for another one. If no money is available then they ask for cigs. If no cigs are available they ask for food last. Im getting tired of it.
8591,31,6 years ago,1 star,"The ebt machine did not work so I used cash but they couldn't give me the correct change because they were out so they tried to short me at first .. I did not get syrup with my breakfast, the sink did not work in the restroom, the security guard was cursing at the customers who are all homeless people, a lady hooked up speakers in the restroom.. I don't get it, I felt like I was in the twilight zone"
8592,31,4 months ago,5 stars,Good Big Mac and fries.
8593,31,5 years ago,2 stars,Very nice inside and clean.... But why do they allow homeless people just to sit and not purchase food? Paying customers need to sit! Not coming to this location again.
8594,31,10 months ago,1 star,Computer says no. No walking through the drive through even though I identify as a car.
8595,31,2 years ago,1 star,What a rippoff?  I order a quarter pounder.  There was no lettuce.  Looked like a small cheese burguer.   Ugly French fries.  In Canada I could eat a better meal than this.
8596,31,4 years ago,1 star,"If i could give them 0 starts i would, they messed up my order and then when i took it back it took them another 10 min to re do it. Plus i was waiting for my order the first time for like 6-10 min, it was thru drive thru. Not satisfied at all"
8597,31,2 years ago,5 stars,"My go to place where I can have my all time favorite cheeseburgers, fish burger and mocha frappe are just a few..and it's close to where I am so it's always best in McDonalds wherever you may be. And of course it should be."
8598,31,4 years ago,5 stars,"Really enjoyed everything about this establishment. Orders are rapid fast and accurate.I had 2 ice cream cones, but I was paying attention to everyone andwhat they were ordering and minimal complaints"
8599,31,a year ago,1 star,"Fries under cooked
Chicken nuggets over cooked,  always messing up my order and this us 4th time ,never coming back just horrible service."
8600,31,a year ago,3 stars,The store in particular was receiving supplies so they were down to 1 drive thru which impacted service but overall it was a standard McDonald's experience.
8601,31,3 years ago,1 star,Im giving it a 1 star because i bought a lot of burgers and fries and they only gave me 2 ketchups. I asked for more ketchup the worker said they cant give more it was  mcdonalds  rules.  MCdonalds is making it hard to enjoy these burgers and fries with no ketchup.
8602,31,4 years ago,2 stars,There is a security guard/cop standing around and he makes me feel unsafe for some reason. A black bum was harrassing me and tell cop looked on. It's not walker friendly as there is a gate around the outside. At least it was clean on the inside.

8608,31,3 years ago,5 stars,"This is where I go to get my morning crack (frappuccino). Very friendly staff. Sometimes its hectic,  because of the area and the locals. Also lots of customers. Even  then it's a fast trip, in and out."
8609,31,4 years ago,5 stars,This place is very nice! The stuff is awesome! My kids were very picky about their food but stuff did a great job! It is very clean place and friendly atmosphere!
8610,31,4 years ago,5 stars,"Went they drive thru, although they couldn't make my food the way I normally get it, the service was very good. Fast and friendly,food was neat and will made."
8611,31,4 years ago,3 stars,"This McDonald's has 2 Drive-Thru Lanes that help to speed things up. However, there's always at least 1 or more homeless persons standing nearby ready to ask for money.

The sausage burritos never really seem fresh.. The ends are hard. This is my experience time and time again when coming to this McDonald's. For the record, I'm usually ordering a sausage burrito about 6 a m. so I would imagine that it would be fresher? ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"

8614,31,6 years ago,1 star,"I sat in the dining room before ordering any food for 5 minutes to catch my breath after walking 5 miles. Security guy approached me saying "" hey man  if you want to sit in here you need to buy something right now if not u need to go back the way you just came"". Guess what I'm the one who decides what, when and where do I buy something."
8615,31,4 years ago,1 star,Worst service ever! Walk up to counter wasnt acknowledged at all. Went to electronic order screen still had to walk to counter to pay took a # for sit down order they didnt bring my food and called out wrong # plus no where to charge phones at all....

A SECURITY GUARD STOOD BY AND SAID NOTHING, and server said nothing. I told them to get away from my window, and one got loud and stupid. Finally the server told them, ""Wait over there or i won't serve you."" They moved. If i was with my family, i would have never opened my window, then left without paying. Since it was just me and my dog, and i was hungry, i put up with their nonsense."

There is a mini Playland for children under about 5 years old, but I recommend mandatory adult supervision since there are some hard surfaces. There is a drive-thru. There are about 20 parking spaces on the small corner lot. Otherwise it is a McDonald's---- ï¿½ï¿"

8980,13,a month ago,2 stars,"One of two McDonald's stores in whole mid/south Miami Beach area so you know what to expect.

It's dirty, restroom has no water or soap to wash hands, except if you use the handicap toilet which makes me wonder how often or ever the employees wash their hands before return back to work. My husband got quite sick the following day because of the food.

We placed the order on the machine for dine-in with table service but there was not a single table # tent available, well the store make it clear that you as a customer should better pickup your own food at the counter. There's absolutely no service at all.

We will never ever go back to this McDonald's ever again."

Is it really hard to hire friendly and customer oriented personnel?!  There are so many seeking employment..
At least teach em to pretend to be nice to customers! That includes Managers, btw.
Further, putting staff on the front counter who fairly understands English is just not fair to them and me, the customer that just wants to pick up an order and leave fast. 'Cause Fast Food you know. Love the Sweet Tea, def. missed the lemon slices, sadly not on their Menu at this Location.

I visited the premises on 5th July 2018 at 8.45am Seriously McDonalds...you need to close this branch down...you cannot continue to offer service this bad under your company logo. 'Service with a smile, you sure don't get that here' as one customer acknowledged....and on that note all the customers agreed. I rest my case."

Again missing the sauce for the Mc nuggets ! Not only I am paying for them as they are part of my menu and the mc nuggets are pretty disgusting with no sauce whatsoever. Since this is a recurrent missing item at each order, I have a question.
Is it the food cost monitoring or a real operation issue ?
May be have them put by the person packaging the mc nuggets instead of the cashier!!!!!!!!!"

9046,13,10 months ago,1 star,"A horrible McDonald's restaurant. It's dirty, service was bad, strange people walk in and out all the time, overall the place looks out dated. It seemed that they blocked some of the cheaper items from the menu around diner time, for example they did not serve the Happy meal with 4 pieces of chicken nuggets. That one was 'out of stock', although the did sell the Happy meal with 6 pieces chicken nugget. What a joke.
If you look for a nice place to eat with your kids, go somewhere else."
9047,13,a year ago,3 stars,Half the menu was listed as out of stock on the kiosk. I ordered a soft drink. They didn't offer it to me when they called my name at the counter because all of the table tents were missing. I reminded them of my drink and they handed me a cup of water. One of my burgers was offset in the bun by almost half and the cheese locked it that way all jacked up. I get the labor shortage and it's a busy place. I would certainly go back. I just can't say I loved it. That would be offensive to all the other places that are outstanding.
9048,13,6 months ago,1 star,How can they have about 20 employees behind the counter and run into stock issues. Everything is sold out. Poor management I say.
9049,13,a year ago,1 star,"McDonald's excels at friendly service and inexpensive, but good quality, food. This franchise has none of that. The staff was efficient enough, but distant and surly. I had two meals there. Both times my food was too cold to eat.

One problem may be the groups of loud and rude teenagers that hang out there. The backs from a long banquette are missing leaving wood laths that poke the back.

All of that is unfortunate because this franchise has a perfect location to shine."

9051,13,a year ago,1 star,"Hello,

I hope this email finds you to inform you that your staff needs to be engaged in coaching due to the lack of attention to a female and I needing to use the restrooms after multiple attempts to utilize them. I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they can't be opened. After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available, after I asked why she said "" they just are "". I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue. She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms. As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER. I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise. I left feeling ""I didn't have it my way "". And that's just a bowl movement. Thank you for your time and I hope this matter has been addressed the next time I pass by the store as I will try to obtain pictures of the staff reluctant to assist.

Best regards,

JJ."

The serving girls treat people as unwanted guests in their own house, not serving people, they would fight with 1/2 of the customers, sending for police 2 or 3 times daily.

It was busy and that can't be an excuse for bad service. Food was great as usual but service gotta improve by mile. The cleanliness was an issue also as there were napkins pretty much all over the place. I guess it was not cleaned since evening. May be business is the priority which is not what Mc does I believe.

The manager, Nancy, request their ""security"" to kick me out. I did absolutely nothing wrong other than charge my phone to make an order.

Not only did their security guard get rude with me they didnt even have the professionalism to let me know it's against rules to charge phone to make an order. Only was charging to phone to make order thru app. Then after getting kicked out they wouldn't give me a refund or my food, said to call number.

Me being black I deal with this a lot. But I hope reviews like this can help wake people up and hold people accountable for discriminatory behavior.

Still want my refund!!!"

9108,13,5 years ago,1 star,"My only visit to this shop and I witnessed these: 1) There were two lines but suddenly one of the staff members stopped taking orders and closed the point-of-sales machine.  Those customers on that line were told to go at the back of the other line.
2) I understand that some staff are new but the supervisor or senior staff are rude to the new staff and do not help train them.  I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t understand the yelling (probably because they are in Spanish).
3) Majority of staff speak Spanish and announce numbers in Spanish.  Expect some misunderstanding when they are taking your order too.  One of the staff put in hot coffee when I ordered hot coffee.
4) Be prepared to wait in a long line and always check your order before you leave the pick up counter.  It was my fault that I did not check/realize my Big Mac and South West salad dressing are missing when I felt.

TLDR?; just donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ýýýs will always be a bad decision anyway."

Very under staffed. Homeless sleeping on the chairs. We ordered 2 coffees and 2 frappes  and waited so long to get them all at different times. I worked at one in NZ  and we would be fired for this kind of thing straight away!
9112,13,5 years ago,1 star,"If I could give this place 0 stars, believe me, I would. By far the worst McDonald's I have EVER been to in the world. I came in to buy a bottle of water (would never even consider eating here given the lack of cleanliness). I waited about five minutes until someone finally told me that they do not have any bottles left. I told them a large fountain water was fine, with ice. Keep in mind - MAYBE 2 people at this McDonald's speak English. Luckily this woman understood me when I communicated what I wanted. I watched her get the cup, fill it with ice, and place it beside the machine! For someone that is just waiting for a drink, pour it, and hand it to the customer. There were maybe a dozen people waiting for their orders. I did not have any other items to wait for - just the water. I waited another 5 minutes to see if someone would just hand me the cup. No one did. I pushed my way through to the front, and got my cup. It was absolute chaos in there; a brutally unorganized establishment. The cashier could have simply turned around, gotten me the bottle of water (or in this case, tell me there are none and pour me a fountain drink), and be on my way. Wasted 10-15 minutes in this place."
9113,13,3 years ago,2 stars,"Not very good service. Unique location but a lot of mismanagement. Some of the crew do not acknowledge you, they'll look at you and walk by while you're trying to get their attention, but keep walking and check on the fries or smoothie machine, then go do something else. I ordered a mobile order which I never did hear my order number called until I inquired about it and the team leader (or ""manager"") said ""I said [mobile order], but you never came up."" I was like there could've been several mobile orders, you weren't specific. And theres constantly food and trash on the floor being picked up, it reminds me of a GTA game."

9115,13,a year ago,3 stars,Bad experience as order not brought to table and electronic ordering system only copes with up to table number 120 and refused to accept our table number 127. Why doesn't the United Kingdom McDonald's App work 8n the USA?
9116,13,a year ago,3 stars,Service was good but sadly the people that were there made the experience horrible. A group of kids was giving the poor kind cleaning lady a hard time and some person went into the restroom and took a shower and left all their clothes in the stall.
9117,13,a year ago,5 stars,Very clean and not too busy for a tourist town. Food was good but the staff could be more approachable.
9118,13,9 months ago,1 star,This was hands down the SLOWEST McDonald's I have ever been to in the whole world. The kitchen was full of employees so I'm not sure why they didn't have their act together.
9119,13,4 years ago,1 star,"Hope you have a lot of time because the wait here is unbelievable, placing an order alone took  me 15 minutes, I work nearby, and 5 out of 5 times I've been here in the overnight time they
Weren't serving coffee,  any items on the value menu, or any grilled items. Not to mention how filthy it is. Also always understaffed. Horrible experience, I don't usually eat McDonalds but working as an overnight around the area is one of the only places open, has been like this for as long as I could remember. Reason for this review is because it's unacceptable that they don't have coffee or value menu items available at nighttime when they should. Wish I could give it -stars."
9120,13,8 years ago,1 star,"I ordered a latte from the Miami Beach Lincoln road branch and waited for my drink. I saw my number flash up on the screen but no one called me. I went up and asked the woman (short reddish hair) who was calling out the order numbers if my number had been called. The answer was no. I kept waiting and still nothing. I asked her again but I was rudely ignored due to her having a chat with her friend. I asked several different people working there about my latte but they all said it's coming and moved on. The staff were either rude, indifferent and just no longer interested in me after I had paid. People came and went with their orders and I was left waiting for my one latte. I said to one woman how long does it take to make a latte? She looked at my ticket and of course no one had even started making it. I was disgusted with the truly terrible customer service. If u want good service do not go to this mcdonalds."

9130,13,3 years ago,1 star,"AVOID! The biggest disappointment about this restaurant is the total lack of service-mindedness of the staff. They got our order wrong, we ordered a dubble cheese burger and got a regular cheese burger instead and their solution was to take said burger and simply slap another patty in it before giving it back. They also forgot to include items in our order like sauces and such, and they couldn't give us a reciept after our purchase.

When my friend asked one staff member for the sauces he ordered she only spoke spanish to him, even though he made it clear that he didn't understand her. After some time and finally getting the sauces the staff laughed as he left.

At least the place was some what clean. Seriously avoid, there are a lot of better food places nearby."
9131,13,4 years ago,1 star,"Place was not noticeable based on the Google maps direction, I ended up looking for a while for it because it is missing the iconic double arches people know. I was looking within the mall area because of the map description, and wished I was across the street as it would have been easier to see. When I entered to place an order, one of the cashier's had an upset look or scowling face towards most customers, and unfriendly look. I didn't like her look so I stepped to the next cashier and I ordered it was fast, I ordered a Happy Meal and was asked if this is for a boy or girl (assuming a toy choice here). I get the order, no toy! And asked all they said was ""no toy, sorry"". I left, I'm not surprised by the lower than usual reviews here. Also when eating my food I ordered triple cheese burger but got doubles instead, at least I was charged for double only."

9133,13,3 years ago,1 star,I don't know where to start. OMG! This is the slowest MCDs restaurant in the world. Staff act like if they were on vacation. You can see in their faces that they hate working here and are just looking forward to the end of their shift. Manager came out after a while and there was no improvement in performance. The automated order system was not working so I waited in line for 10 mins. just to order and pay. From this point it was exactly 27 mins. until my order was ready. All that was was a bottle of water and a mocha coffee. And I had to ask them otherwise it would have been more than half hour. I reckon staff must really ask themselves whether they want to work here. There may be other better places where they could find job satisfaction. Here they're just turning a bunch of people into unhappy customers.
9134,13,3 years ago,4 stars,The service was good but there was this 1 weird guys that was asking for money to buy a sandwich to eat which I had no problem giving him $3 and the other guy going in and out and sitting down together with the guy asking for money to eat a sandwich and asking out for 1 or 2 lucy (in case for those who dont understand its cigarettes). The managers should be putting additional people at the register for them to see thilese things because the look on some customers where not comforting with the situation.
9135,13,4 years ago,1 star,"Waited one hour for a 4 piece chicken nugget happy meal. Disorganized, unapologetic, and zero customer service. The kiosk machine for fast service was anything but that. They lost my order and the manager didn't want to step up to admit so."
9136,13,2 years ago,1 star,If I couldn't give a star I would because the service over there is poorly I order a salad and they did not give me a fork so I asked for 4 for one. I was standing there for 3 minutes and then I asked her again for it and she told me no. Worst service ever.

I wait about 5 minutes and ask, is he returning to take orders, and was told no we only have one line now. The employees were rude, the lines were unbelievably long, and it took about 40 minutes to order and receive your food.#TheMcDonald'sfromHELL"

9141,13,3 years ago,1 star,"The food is average here like all McDonald's nothing so bad like cold food or anything .the bad part about this location is that it somewhat seems to be a safe haven for bums and schizophrenic drug addicts. Everytime I have ever went here I am approached by someone asking for money or food , its ridiculous... it's like they all hide in there and come out to beg when a new customer enters. Last time I was there a bum with an injured leg was high on crack or something and scratching his open wound with the gauze removed.. completely disgusting, miami filthy ."

They moved the slowest I've ever seen a human move, the were lethargic and made it clear they couldn't care less. All of them! Out of two orders, they got both wrong. It's a testament to McDonald's that their general standards are so high, across the world in my experience, that this terrible restaurant stands out as an exception. Whoever does their quality audits needs sacking, or spend more time there."

I told the young lady at the counter that I understood it was late and they don't usually allow ppl you use the restrooms after a certain time but I was having an emergency and knew no where else to go. I was willing to make a purchase in exchange. I pretty much just paid to use the restroom bc the food was old and very disgusting. I was shocked. There was a group ahead of me. Everytime they asked for something they were told it wasn't available and had to order things they didn't want. I was told I couldn't get a medium fry, I ""had"" to purchase a large. Like really?.. I'm grateful to the young lady for letting me use the restroom but it was also extremely gross. Who is running this place?"

However he did have time to come into the lobby and joke around with other Hispanic guests. I had to place my order with another cashier ( who was sufficient) My food was thrown into a bag and shoved at me by another crew member. All of the food was cold and the sweet tea tasted of coffee grounds. All of the tables were dirty and sticky. Having dined in and watched this gross misconduct happen to several guest. Having been a former Manager of a McDonald's it was a duty to share this experience with your company. To be honest if this store was in any other location it would go out of business for extremely horrible customer service and filthy establishment.

Whoever manages this branch should be ashamed of the shamblic lack of customer service here."

You can always expect your drink to be watered down since they have them sitting pre-made.

One employee even asked for a straw and a pregnant employee asked him if he wanted to be masturbated by her left or right hand.

Ahhh!"

For the first time in my life i was afraid inside a mcdonalds. Not returning for sure."
9207,13,5 years ago,1 star,"I would give it -5 if I could.
Total DISGRACE to McD brand.
We placed an order and paid at the self-serve kiosk. Receipt did not print out. Took our order # in vain hope of seeing the food. No such luck. You need to push yourself through the crowd at checkout counter to wait for order to come out. After 10+ minutes, we heard ""quatro"" screamed out by an employee.  That could have been our order, except it was missing few pieces, and none of the employees at food handout desk spoke any English to understand what I was telling them. NONE.  And my Spanish was not good enough to get the point t across either.
I went back in line, waited another 10mins to speak to a woman taking orders manually, who had to ask for an English speaking manager to troubleshoot our order.  Eventually, order was remedied, handout employee was instructed in Spanish how to fix our order, which she did, finally handing food to us with a farewell message of ""go cuno"".
You can lookup what that means, or avoid our mistake and NEVER go to this McD at all costs."
9208,13,5 years ago,1 star,"The staff doesn't speak english. I used the kiosk and they were supposed to bring the food to our table, that didn't happen. My food was cold and stale, i complained and was ignored for 5 min mainly because they didn't speak english.... No Good!!! i would understand if the menu was in spanish but it's in english, don't you think that they people that aere serving you should understand the language the menu is in???"
9209,13,5 years ago,5 stars,"The wait in the lines was a turn off but it's understandable because of it's location, there's a high demand because people seek fast food, something fast to eat. Just like any Mcdonald's location the meal will fill you but you may want to take it to go if you die for those peaceful eats."
9210,13,6 years ago,1 star,"This McDonalds serves as the poster child to why they should fully automated. The service is terrible. 9pm on a Saturday night and you'd think they've never served humans before. More employees standing around doing nothing while the line stretches to the back of the store.  Half the items in the menu aren't even available. One employee endlessly walks around the dinning area sweeping up nothing. Food arrives...french fries literary have no seasoning at all. I ask for salt, may as well be asking for solid gold."
9211,13,3 years ago,1 star,This was the worst McDonald's I have ever been in the manager was incompetent and the people behind the counter were just as much of idiots as he was they actual tried to tell us that they gove the food and then give the drinks later McDonald's corporate needs to get involved im this location the manager and people behind the counter were yelling at people after people had to wait 30 mintues to get there drinks I finally gave up after 45 minutes I ask 4 times 4 my ice creams and drinks before I got 3 whole dollars back. and spoken to like I did not onow what I was talking about I have never been in a McDonald's that gives food first and drink later... Horrible service and horrible people that work there.
9212,13,4 years ago,1 star,"Truly awful. Everything was broken down, many menu items weren't available. The nuggets that I did manage to get were overcooked--not quite briquets, but definitely crispier than I expect.

Possibly coz the profit is not good to pay a cleaner ?   You should say 'Mcdonalds & partners' coz the customers use the surrounding restaurants ""and streets"" to wash their hands or to pee. Still Unique, coz you cant find this in suburbans of Delhi, or Khartoum.  Shame...."
9215,13,8 years ago,1 star,"A true rip off! They automatically upgrade you for a large meal without asking you anything! I didn't realize right away. When I went back to the register, the girl said that's how it was if you don't specify you want a regular meal... Where else have you seen that??? She didn't apologize or offer me to refund the difference or anything... I asked to talk to a manager and she said she was the manager!!! Waow what a customer service! Anyway it's not for how much extra you pay it's just the fact that Mac Donald is a big corporation and shouldn't allow that kind of policy because the place is packed of tourists and staff take advantage of it. It's unbelievable to treat customer that way!"
9216,13,5 years ago,1 star,"Worst customer service ever employees are rude and not helpful at all,  I Sat an watched 2 employees sit in the dinning area and just chat for over 30 min while the restaurant was busy.  Tables were very dirty had to clean my own to use.  Don't ever eat here."

9218,13,5 years ago,1 star,You know why this McDonalds is rated so low? It's because they have 6 ITEMS ON THE MENU EXCLUDING FRIES AND DRINKS! This place is trash! Had to wait 30 minutes in line just go get 2 quarter pounders and 2 fries! If you're in Miami I'm warning you do not go here! There's much better places in Miami to eat then this garbage.

9220,13,5 years ago,1 star,One of the worst McDonald's I've been. The staff is so unhelpful and with really bad attitude. The ordering kiosks never works and usually one person taking orders for like 10-15 customers. Everytime I'm here always people walk out. And after waiting for 25 minutes to order they don't have most of the menu items available. Worst staff ever
9221,13,6 years ago,1 star,"Worst McDonald on planet earth!! Sloppy service, dirty, limited selection on the menu. I believe mc Donald is losing millions with this place.
Once I ordered a double quarter pound and got a single. Once I ordered a single and got a double. One night I order a quarter pound but they had no more so I order a cheese burger and had no more I just left the place.
Also after a certain time they only serve large meals, no small nor medium."
9222,13,10 years ago,2 stars,"Service was absolutly shocking, I have been there twice now (Breakfast / Lunch) and I have been served but the same ignorant girl both times. Even though it is only fast food I still expect the service to out-shine everything else. She needs a lesson in hospitality, or go and find another job that is far away from dealing with a customer face to face.
The decor could do with up dating, but its surroundings with the style of Miami Beach being art deco / retro makes it fit in.
Food - Breakfast was great, quality was great, had to ask for sugar and was given 17 packets for some reason. Lunch was poor, no quality there, cold fries, and it was busy! So that makes no sence.

Overall - Poor. Wont be going back there in a rush!!"

A little bit filthy. 4 workers doing nothing and eating ice cream instead of serving customers.

The staff are totally clueless, rude and have no concept of customer service. I waited for 10 minutes on my double quarter with fries, when it came out, the fries were cold as could be. The cashier couldn't care less about my cold fries as she was busy flirting with some seedy looking guy who was hanging out around the counter. This restaurant would maybe be ok in the urban sprawl of Chicago or Baltimore, but I expected much more from one in South Beach. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
9231,13,5 years ago,1 star,Worst experience ever!!!  Didn't have anything on the menu. When we finally found something we could actually get it was cold. The buns had been toasted long before the burger was made. Not even warm enough to melt the cheese!!  Never again!!

9244,13,3 years ago,5 stars,"Despite it being rush hour in Miami Beach, the place didn't seem dirty nor the restrooms. The is no parking near the McDonalds so you'd have to find a way to park yourself. Customer Interaction was minimal, which was good(for me), because this McDonalds had a purchasing mechanism for people to buy whatever they want there and receive a receipt to show the cashier and you're basically done, all that's left is waiting for your food. Quick Tip: You are able to pay with cash if you prepurchase, but the money will go to the cashier, not the mechanism. The mechanism does accept any kind of Credit/Debit card."

9272,13,3 years ago,1 star,Service horribly slow (more than 20 min to prepare a simple order outside rush hours). Unpleasant staff.

9277,13,6 years ago,1 star,I required some hot water for my parents but they wanted to charge me for a tea. This could be no problem as a routine. Just make me somewhat uncomfortable.

9279,13,6 years ago,1 star,"Mc Donalds 1650 washington ave

This was a terrible experience with this gay guy, he is rude with customers and employees. I was standing for about 5 minutes in line, and i asked him why he is not taking my order, and he said:
I dont have 4 hands, i take orders after i finished serving all the orders. Im not gonna get a stroke.
Come one man! You are working in a Mc Donalds, you have to be fast and take orders while serving! That job is not for that guy. There are a lot of good workers out there who needs a job, and that guy dont appreciate that. I hear him saying to another employee: change your face because if you dont like it you can quit!

I would never go to that mc donalds! Never in my life! I never had such a bad experience with a gay! Those people are nice 100%! But this one has some problems!"

The front workers did not know how to speak english ... Am I in the USA?! .. Pls
They did not have mac sauce."
9282,13,4 years ago,1 star,The worst McDonald's known to man. I would rather traverse the dmz nude than visit this monument to inefficiency. Visiting after 10pm? Only 8 value meals are available. And chances they get your order right with the reduced menu? 0.  Literally 0 for 6 in the 10 months I've lived close to this location. Save your sanity and Walk the extra distance to Alton and 16th and visit that location.
9283,13,3 years ago,4 stars,"Ours a McDonald's..when you want it you want it. Ours the convenience ave reliability you go for when you do.

9285,13,4 years ago,5 stars,"Not lovin it. Dear all McDonald's, please shut the business down or sell actual food please. I can't believe the FDA ACTUALLY approves of this plastic food industry. Exhibit A- chicken nuggets. This gunk does not tear like an actual chicken. I rest my case."
9286,13,6 years ago,1 star,"SCAM, when I went here a first time, the waiter Mauricio gave me a wrong change, I've said nothing. The second time I've returned with this same waiter and he gave me the wrong change again. I've said to him, he took my money and my ticket and he gave me less than before ! As I haven't my ticket anymore, I haven't anything to prove it... It's a shame !"
9287,13,5 years ago,1 star,Employees are very rude and they give you whatever they feel like giving you . I ordered 20 nuggets they gave me no sauce. I asked for sauce the cashier gave me attitude AND they were out of all of the sauce except BBQ. This is the worst McDonald's ever

9300,13,3 years ago,4 stars,"Typical McDonald's Fast Food Restaurant if on a budget in South Beach this is ideal, store manager needs to deal with those coming into store and not purchasing food or drink can be intimidating for some people."

9562,5,3 years ago,2 stars,"Two stars just for the brand, but let me be real here, the staff needs training in this location. Customer service not good! Every time when I go there is a long wait, I'm talking about waiting over 20 minutes or more to get your order, and the bad thing is there is not a lot of customers to have this long wait. Maybe they are always cooking everything from scratch ? I almost forgot to mention the funny part, one day I was a hurry and could not stop my scooter, so I went to the drive through and the lady told me on the speaker ""mamm please come inside, we do not serve people on scooters on drive through !! I was so upset and could not find a place to lock my scooter and I gave up on the whole mac thing, I just go there because my daughter likes to eat Md.!   You can also find some homeless and  junkies from the beach gathering inside to use restrooms.  Maybe just because is the beach area I suppose !"

BIP BIP BIP constantly.
The cookers also clean the toilets.
The Sistem twice a month doesn't work.
Long time for order meal."

I normally won't review fast food places, but when I use the restroom at this location it was absolutely sparkling there was also a schedule on the door on the way out that showed when and who cleaned the restroom last I appreciate it that. The food was typical McDonald's good but probably unhealthy. :-)"

9569,5,4 years ago,1 star,Probably the worst McDonald's in the area. The crew is always slow. The service is never fast. The restrooms and dining are are sometimes dirty but that's because of the customers. Thank goodness they have kiosks to order food. I recommend ordering through the mobile app if possible. They're always busy. They'd get more stars if they improved their service first.
9570,5,a year ago,1 star,"Terrible at the night. Staff is unfriendly and sometimes rude, when after 40 minutes of waiting, I asked where my order was, a guy named Gustavo just turned away and left.  They say that they have a lot of orders and few people.  Firstly, at least two people there only did what they went back and forth, but they could help other employees to speed up the process.  But my god, why should the service suffer from this?  Hire more people for the weekend.  Or did you not guess that people come to you on Saturday night? Supervisors need to conduct trainings for staff, otherwise they forgot how to communicate with customers and how the company makes money.  And in the end, where is your smile?  Or are the good old days of smiling gone?"

Night shift girl refused to refund. Owner contact me. I watched as your staff be disrespectful to others. Giving food out for free to groups of Mexican kids. Garbage everywhere inside and out. I am on vacation this week nothing but time will be making phone calls all week. Wrong person people.
9576,5,a year ago,5 stars,Excellent experience. Went through the drive-thru and met the kindest employee James. Now let me tell you about James. He was humorous and really made my McDonalds experience one to remember. He made us laugh unexpectedly which was quite a nice surprise. 10/10 would recommend befriending James as he is a wonderful and positive employee.

Will Never come back to this place."
9579,5,a year ago,3 stars,The food is ok. But the food was also already sitting out.m. But the garbage is overflowing outside and the ground outside is filthy. The workers look overwhelmed and overworked. There's a lot of garbage hanging out of the container. The bathroom smelled like it was cleaned with a dirty mop and pee. The woman at the counter was polite and nice. She makes this review higher than the one star this McDonald's deserves.
9580,5,a year ago,3 stars,"Good deals on their app. No restroom available, not good for paying customers. Service is somewhat friendly, they laugh a lot, not that's it's bad but a lot of extra laughter makes you wonder what's so super funny? I wanna laugh too! ;)
Ordered a large iced coffee,  was a good value but my idea of extra ice is different than theirs.  Other McDonald's I was able to do the pumpkin spiced coffee with the deal/ coupon but not here,  oh well can't beat a large ice coffee for 99 cents + tax."

9583,5,a year ago,1 star,"Seriously, this McDonald's is the WORST I've ever seen! Advertise themselves as being 24/7, but are always closed when I go at night. The staff is rude, and I'm always waiting for what seems like forever (usually 20+ minutes). The worst part about this place is that they consistently screw up EVERY order. Hell, half my order will be missing (like it was just now), and they'll flat out REFUSE to fix it."
9584,5,a month ago,1 star,Food is poor...service is bad...long wait for food
9585,5,2 years ago,1 star,"Unbelievable that everyone else has the same complaint as me...they never get the order right.

Tonight, I realized that they forgot an item after coming home with food for the family. I first tried to call just to get reimbursed...but no one answered the phone.

Then I decided to drive back for a refund while the rest of my food went cold on my dining room table. When I got to the drive thru, I politely asked for a refund for the item they forgot.

Having worked in the food industry myself in the past, the service was awful. For the sheer inconvenience, they should have refunded me and at least offered the missing item to me free of charge. However, all that was given was a refund...not even an apology to go along with it.

Terrible service along with the terrible cold food that I then had to go eat at home (thanks to my having to drive back for a refund).

Mistakes can happen but not as often as they happen here. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this location!!!"

9587,5,2 years ago,1 star,"Location a bit of an inconvenience, service could have been better. Cashier was slow, did not ring up my order  correctly, had on gloves and was touching his hat, money, pulled his phone out of his pocket several times and was handling food.... this is not sanitary! Not happy at the fact that we waited for 15 minutes for 3 large fries as we watched the drive thru serve 8 other orders before ours, and we were the only customers inside at the time.... Having worked for mcdonalds in the past, I know for a FACT it takes just a little over 2 minutes to fry a full basket of fries (which leads 3 large fries). And if they had 3 baskets down at once (which they did) then there should be no reason to have had us wait for so long. Will not return to this location!"
9588,5,a year ago,2 stars,"I've been here many times, usually after midnight as I work late. Recently, the majority of the times I've gone through the drive through they say that they're closed, but when I ask what their hours are they say ""oh we're just closed for an hour""- this has happened to me at 2am last night, 4am last week, etc.

My issue is with the restaurant claiming to be open 24h even though it definitely isn't."
9589,5,2 years ago,1 star,"This is the most disorganized Mc Donalds I have been to in my life. They are the slowest, most unprofessional and disrespectful one that I have ever seen. I live at the corner, so I did not have a single experience. It was multiple ones, and it is always the same terrible service. Once I had to wait 30 minutes for a simple and 'should be quick' coffee. But the last time I went there was the worst. I stayed around 20 minutes in the counter and nobody was capable to ask me if was in need of something. I was picking an order up, which took me almost 1 hour (20 minutes until somebody talked to me + 30 minutes waiting for the food). They are just always so messy that from now on every time I want to eat a burger, I consider first going to Wendy's or Jack in the Box, or another Mc Donalds store... not this one anymore"

9597,5,a year ago,4 stars,"The drivethru line at this location is, had been, and will always be broken. Dont ask me why, because i do not know. Maybe it is because the 3rd window is rarely used. Idk, but go inside if you have a small order as its faster to go to a register. Check your order when they are super busy as they give you a diet, or another order on occasion. Otherwise my favorite place to get a large coke, for $1$."
9598,5,3 years ago,2 stars,"Good place, and good location. But staff needs training. Some workers are very very slow, and you can tell that they are not familiar with the menu and point of sale machines. It took them 15 minutes to make my caramel macchiato. Hopefully it will improve over time."

The staff is always nice tho. You can't dine in or done on their patio. You can't use their restrooms either. They do wear face masks and require you to wear one when going inside the establishment.

9601,5,a year ago,1 star,"Generally you know what you're getting when you go to a McDonald's drive thru, but not at this location! Burgers were messy and not stacked properly, fries were almost inedible - soggy and barely room temp. Hard pass, go somewhere else."
9602,5,a year ago,2 stars,"This place is a total wreck most of the time. This is an extremely busy location and I've been going here for years as a customer and also as a delivery driver and it's astonishing that pandemic or not, they still have the same issues. They are never prepared to maintain the volume of business. You often have to repeat yourself multiple times when communicating with the staff. If you go at night (particularly late-night) there's likely to be a long line in drive-thru or inside. They regularly claim their ""system is down"" and so are unable to accommodate you. It's completely upsurd. I don't understand how any establishment can think that this mode of operation is acceptable. Other than that, typical McDonald's."
9603,5,3 years ago,1 star,"Been to this location 5 times now and have NEVER had a good experience. The first two times I waited 30 minutes with only a couple of cars in front of me the first time and NONE in front of me the 2nd. The first time was so bad that the whole line of cars were honking and going over the curbs to get out of line. These people take FOREVER and are rude as hell. Not sure if they need new management or a whole new workforce but this place is AWFUL.

I have two kids now and they of course like McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s.  They recently renovated it so I was optimistic and took them in there for breakfast.  Right away there was a bum outside the door yelling to himself and when we walked in there was another one lying on the ground next to the tables.  I went back a month later for happy meals and the kids wanted to eat there.  All the tables and floors were dirty and they still had bums outside and in.  While we were waiting for the food a homeless guy wanted to use the bathroom but there was a lock on it. When he asked a worker they said it was for customers only and the homeless guy started  only a block from my house.
9608,5,2 years ago,1 star,"I have traveled all across the world..I have eaten at McDonald's in the UK, Japan, Mexico and across America. The McDonald's at 1121 Garnet Ave in Pacific Beach has to be the very worst Mcdonald's ever! This reflects on the managers and poorly trained staff. The staff is very rude and incompetent. I now travel to the other Mcdonald's on 4711 Mission Bay Dr. The staff are polite, well trained and food is always hot fresh and up to Mcdonald's standard quality."

Waited around 10 more mins once I got there and had to politely deal with the wasted day drinkers that I was trying to avoid by ordering online. Food was what you'd expect from McDonald's. All in all 3 stars was definitely rounding up. On a positive note, I would say that the inside was much nicer than what I remember them looking like when I was a youngster.

9613,5,5 years ago,2 stars,I mean it's McDonald's right? You know what to expect from the food which is both a plus and a minus. However at this particular McDonald's right on Garnet in Pacific Beach they are undergoing Construction. It seems like a complete redo the outside and some of the guest areas as well. It's a mess and noisy but does not look like any RI modeling of the kitchen area is being done. That makes me wonder why this has become the worst drive-through around even before the construction. Two cars in front of me still waited almost 10 minutes. Isn't that a lot from McDonald's? Or foremost drive-thrus these days it seems to be way too much time. Now I'm not just saying this because of today's visit this is been the case at this McDonald's now for the past couple of months. Maybe it's short-handed help but that would only be an excuse for once in awhile. Anyway not a great experience but probably should be eating elsewhere anyway.
9614,5,4 years ago,1 star,Physically waited in line for a hour while the drive thru and uber eats received seniority. Most had already walked away after placing an order with random folks taking what they can get unchecked as the attendants stopped caring after the first 10 minutes. Please close this location as it is no longer viable
9615,5,3 years ago,2 stars,I went for an ice cream cone and it's always sketchy. A lot of times they don't have ice cream. This time they were cleaning the machine in the middle of the day. That's just stupid. No ice cream cones or milkshakes or any other ice cream products McDonald's is known for this though. Not just this one. I don't eat their food because most of it sucks.

Angry managers! Very understaffed. They messed up a lot of orders back to back. There was a lot of people waiting for their order. They messed up my order twice and it took them forever to replace my order. There is homeless people here panhandling. Management is absolutely awful! They would never let a place like this run in North County... I expected more from this place. Worst experience ever.

When I went to pick up my order I did ask the manager and he said they do take the coupons from the app. I told him the cashier said they didn't so I was not able to use my coupon.

She was being trained at the same time but couldn't even talk to me. I understand Spanish is needed sometimes especially in Southern California, but when it's busy and you're the only one working the register and the main language is English, what are you going to do. What's really going to happen is you're going to restrict what your customers are able to order. I order the same thing every time I decide to come to McDonalds so I have no complaints about the food, but this time it compelled me to write a review. Was an uncomfortable situation today."

9637,5,3 years ago,1 star,"I've been going to this McDonalds since 1995 when I was a kid.  The service here is horrible    I ordered a hot tea at the drive thru and the kid at the window was extremely rude.   He opened the window and said ""its $1.83.""  When I asked for an extra cup and some honey he rolled his eyes as if I was asking for way to much.
I know its McDonalds and you cant expect exceptional service but dont make it so obvious that you're being rude on purpose."
9638,5,4 years ago,5 stars,This place is awesome it lets us Uber drivers use the restroom and we can take a break inside any time. Got some cheeseburgers earlier today and a large diet Coke everything for under 4 bucks. The manager there just needs to smile a little more!
9639,5,3 years ago,3 stars,Service was subpar today. Food was bland and warm at best. Cashiers treated us like we were an inconvenience. Reminds us why we don't go to this location even though it's easier to drive to

9642,5,5 years ago,5 stars,Donald's app is the app that keeps on giving and their mobile ordering is awesome I just barely had any money left for food the other day pull up into one of their new mobile ordering parking spots turn on the location in the phone to see what deals they going to throw at me couple bucks left on my card all of a sudden buy anything on the menu get a free sandwich mobile order only I bought myself a small shake for $2 I got one of those Artisan Chef burgers for 6 bucks my total $2.16 I was able to have a meal with what I had and that burger was delicious I didn't even have to get out of my truck I wasn't feeling so well and they brought it out to that parking spot promptly and it was hot and fresh awesome I'm loving it
9643,5,5 years ago,1 star,"Manager on duty Ignacio extremely hostile and rude. I am an Uber driver and I have visited this location two weekends in a row. It is a very busy location on Saturday evenings. On my first visit I went to the drive-thru and ordered $10 worth of food and then parked and ran inside to ask to use the restroom he told me I had to pay a quarter. I then explain to him that I just had come through the drive-thru and I was a customer he said oh well.. you have to pay a quarter. On my second visit one week later I walked in ordered a coffee and politely asked him for a token for the restroom, Ignacio appeared to become upset by my request so much so, that he actually tossed it at me hard enough for it to bounce off the counter and land on the floor. He did not apologize...he just walked off.I feel he should be reprimanded for his blatant disrespect and rude Behavior towards paying customers. If this location is too much for him to handle maybe he should transfer somewhere else. I will never return to this McDonald's again as long as the manager Ignacio is in charge."
9644,5,3 years ago,1 star,Quarter Pounder was actually missing the meat patty. French fries tasted like they were cooked last week. Still took 15 minutes in the drive through with only one other car.
9645,5,4 years ago,4 stars,"Drive thru is usually pretty fast. Always love the sausage muffins without egg. Getting there can be a pain.

9646,5,2 years ago,2 stars,Currently there is no reason to mantein the restroom closed. These guys are taking advantage of the initial restrictions when the COVID-19 pandemic started to avoid making the bathroom easier for costumers. Other McDonald's in San Diego have already opened their bathrooms to the public and like most restaurants in SD.
9647,5,3 years ago,1 star,"Chips were not hot and staff seemed too busy to talk when I tried to get condiments. There was a few customers but the bag was basically thrown at you and then you were never looked at again.

Edit: I've since been back and my friend had to wait 10minutes for a Coke. They then tried to claim they'd called it (when they had clearly forgotten about it as it was sitting on the drinks machine with no lid). Not sure what the management of the place is like but they'd want to change something. Staff are awful and rude."
9648,5,5 years ago,3 stars,I have been here several times after 1am - 3am and there are no employees anywhere. Doors and drive thru shutdown. 24 hours on some days but not every day. Take your chance.Roll the dice. It is good exercise walking there and back.
9649,5,2 years ago,1 star,stuck in the drive thru over 25 minutes (cars in front and behind us) and they had no drinks available. put a huge damper on the vacation. employees were clearly irritated and rude. by far the worst McDonald's experience ever.

9651,5,4 years ago,1 star,"McDonald's generally sucks out loud. This one is even worse. I don't think the drive thru has ever gotten an order correct. They're constantly running out of staple items i.e. they don't have fries at the ready or the shake machine is busted. If that's not bad enough, it's a hang out for the local homeless. And not decent homeless...the methed out violent type."
9652,5,a year ago,2 stars,"They messed up our order on two different occasions in the drive thru. I do appreciate the enthusiasm they have, I also just want my order right."
9653,5,4 years ago,3 stars,"Food was good. Service staff was clueless. Watched 3 orders get served ahead of me, all 3 were wrong in some way. All 3 had to ask for drink. Many minutes of clueless staring at order screens trying to figure it out. They gave me an extra sandwich i didn't order."
9654,5,4 years ago,1 star,"Disgusting there was a customer who walked up to the counter and said his big mac was cold. The manager traded the burger with another and put the one the customer brought BACK in the hot warmer to resell. An employee asked her if she should throw it away the manager told her no, it's ok. GROSS"
9655,5,5 years ago,5 stars,"Very nice stablishment. Just got remodeled and it also has a big parking lot. It has restrooms accesible with a quarter or a coin obtained from the cashier. They always habe everything that is served on the menu (except ice cream). The service is very good and most of the people in there speak Spanish, so it is a plus for those who don't speak English."
9656,5,5 years ago,3 stars,"You need a coin to access the restroom, if you come late at night on the weekend, you take your chances running into drunk frat boys or girls, tourists who don't know how to wait their turn and homeless folks.
The entire crew was Spanish speaking, not a problem for me but apparently the frat boys were having none of it, they were rude and ignorant."
9657,5,5 years ago,1 star,The staff charged for the wrong meal and never offered to reimburse the difference.  One of my kids asked for yogurt she gave apple.  One of the drinks was supposed to be lemonade she gave sprite.  The bun was hard and stale tasting on my sandwich.  My entire food was cold.

9677,5,3 years ago,1 star,Its basically a 24 hour homeless shelter that serves food & takes food stamp ebt card. Usually several parking spots are congregations of homeless and their gear. Its always like this as McDonald's allows it. Not the safest place. If you must use the drive thru only.

9680,5,4 years ago,3 stars,They accept EBT in the drive thru which is great! Although they got my order wrong and the drink wrong but quickly fixed it with no fuss. It's about what you expect from any ol Mickey D's
9681,5,5 years ago,2 stars,Very slow service beside expected business during the late night. I would not recommend if you would like to get your food quickly during late night weekends. It is as if they do not prepare for the late night rush.
9682,5,a year ago,3 stars,Back in the day Mickey D's commanded the overall burger experience. But these days their menu is bland. Number 3 on my list.
9683,5,5 years ago,4 stars,"The staff has to constantly deal with the homeless community that is always loitering around this place. The McDonald's restaurant is clean and the food is up to par, but the environment could be better."

9685,5,6 years ago,4 stars,"Four stars only because it's open 24 hours (not just the drive thru) and is one of the few late night bathroom options for Lyft and Uber drivers.  Popular with the homeless crowd for the same reason though and it's still a McDonald's, eat at your own risk."
9686,5,3 years ago,1 star,Not open 24 hours -_- they said they close from 2 am - 6 am even the drive-thru but they will serve people ordering on food delivery apps? Didn't make much sense to me when they are supposed to be open 24 hours and still make food for delivery orders

I saw 2 buses stopping in to feed their passengers during my short visit here, on top of the regular customers and/or those that are traveling by cars. Just like those working at Mickey D's over the border in the Canadian side (mainly showing French), these workers only spoke English and weren't too thrilled about French-only customers. I used the app to place my order, which was more convenient and the workers seemed to appreciate that more, since they don't have to deal with extra people face-to-face. My order came out in timely manner (even with tons of tourists flooding in) and the food was good. Staff was friendly as they get. Huge parki"
10211,0,5 years ago,4 stars,Stopped in for a quick visit at this newly built location. Nice bright dining room with fresh flowers on the tables. The usual self ordering screens or a helpful staff behind the counter waiting to take your order. If you are in need of food on the go this location has you covered. Two drive through lanes and mobile order curbside spots so as to get you back on the road faster. As McDonalds go this is a great improvement.

I also work in a restaurant and know how to deal with the customers and uber orders."

Staff needs some training in customer service, I felt like we were inconveniencing them for ordering.  Manager who was at the counter and served our food to us was very nice though.  Overall, it's a convenient pit-stop on route 11, easy to access, well lit and plenty of parking for cars, trucks, and RV's."
10239,0,11 months ago,1 star,The owner of this McDonald's needs to read this.  When you have a breakfast special  you should want to please the customer. If the customer wants 2 sausage biscuits instead of 2 bacon biscuits  are a customer would prefer a a certain type of bread for there breafast sandwich special you should not put stipulations on what type of bread they want.  Other McDonald's have catered to my needs if your not willing to cater to customer needs then you will have less customers.  Also charging for ranch not everyone can eat ketchup because of acid and stomach problems and need ranch for there fries instead of ketchup. Anyone that says they need ranch for there fries are hashbrown not just chicken nuggets because they have stomach issues you should make exception to that for that.  And one last thing.  Your workers look miserable not one of them smiles at me im very outgoing person.  You need to explain to your workers that there attitudes are sour and need to cheer up. We all have bad days but when somone looks like they hate being there based off of there unfriendly customer service then they need more training.   Night service is better from my experience but the morning service needs to be looked at.  It's not fun to drive up and the worker gives you that look like they hate you and shows no customer service skills at all. Thank you for your understanding. Take my advice and you will have more customers

In fact, they had no bagels at all. We ordered the muffing egg meals but got the biscuit meal. It also took them a while to get our order."

10243,0,3 years ago,5 stars,"Best McDonald's I've ever visited. Clean, with flowers on the table and table service. As good as it gets for a fast food restaurant. Bravo."
10244,0,5 years ago,5 stars,I never give McDonalds a 5 Star but this newly build restaurant has table service and the food is hot and terrific. There was a older store here previously but this new one is da bomb.
10245,0,a year ago,2 stars,Ordered two Mcdoubles...one with ketchup only the other plain. The one with ketchup was so messy you couldn't even handle it and the other wasn't plain. The order was printed correctly on the receipt. Are these employees just not able to read?

10249,0,5 years ago,5 stars,Really nice place and experience! Higly recommend it! Even for a date!
10250,0,a year ago,4 stars,The service was great surprisingly! Our food was hot and they actually had our order completely correct! Which is a big plus for this McDonald's. I do recommend McDonald's if you go at the right times
10251,0,a week ago,2 stars,Only stop here if you have to.
10252,0,a year ago,3 stars,"This could be a fluke but on 3 separate occasions when I have gone there over the past 2 months their soda machine was not working.  So you couldn't order a meal deal.  Other than that it is a nice, regular McDonald's"
10253,0,2 years ago,2 stars,Stopped here at the Champlain location for a quick bite while on my way home. The service was extremely slow. The employee tasked with serving the food to customers walked out and took several minutes to return and upon return took several more minutes to serve the food. The food was subpar as well. My recommendation is to avoid
10254,0,a year ago,2 stars,"The french fries were stale.

Edit: dropped one more star, it was noon only car in drive through ordered a double cheeseburger and fries. Got to the window from there they sent me to there 3rd window  where i sat for 10mins until i got my food. The fries were half full and stale. The cheeseburger was good though."
10255,0,10 months ago,1 star,A complete joke I told them I wanted a medium meal they charged me for a large and when I asked it to be fixed they said ok and didn't fix it . I will never go there again .then when I asked for ranch I was told they didn't have any but my girlfriend went in and asked for it up front and they gave it to her . I would of gave 0 if possible .
10256,0,a year ago,2 stars,Went for the coffee which was fine. But also ordered a breakfast sandwich and a hash brown. They had an excessive amount of grease. Couldn't finish it.
10257,0,a year ago,1 star,"We grabbed dinner Sunday evening, 2 x 2 cheese burger meals and 1 chicken nugget happy meal. We jumped back on the road to head home to peru after a hockey game. We opened our yellow cheese burger wrappers to find all 4 cheese burgers were missing the cheese. What a disappointment after a long day and drive."

10259,0,5 years ago,5 stars,"I have to say how impressed I am with this McDonald's. It is one of the very few fast food restaurants I've been to that always put a smile on your face. The staff is super courteous. The food is always good. The fries are always hot. Whenever I cross the border, I try to stop here just because I know the service is impeccable. They deserve an award for being so friendly."
10260,0,11 months ago,3 stars,"Employees need to take more care in their sandwich assembly. To be fair, the employer should pay a more competitive wage to incentivize better work."
10261,0,a year ago,3 stars,The ordering system was fancy there. We could take our time to decide what to order and did not have worry about staff waiting for your order. The food price is too high given the quality.
10262,0,2 years ago,5 stars,My visit went well. The employees were busy working yet friendly and attentive. I used the McD app for the first time here also. Always glad to get a good deal and great service. Good job.
10263,0,4 years ago,4 stars,"Service is slow, even even when the place is empty. I wouldn't dare go when the place is actually busy. It's a bit expected since it's so close to the border.
The interior seems pretty clean and the customer service is decent. I've only been on days when it's not busy, so my experiences have been decent."
10264,0,9 months ago,1 star,"Worst coffee drink in my whole life, literally threw up in the parking lot & threw it away after 1 sip. I don't plan on coming here again."
10265,0,a year ago,2 stars,Give the wrong burger  i asked  for double qpounder  and drive half mile and find I didn't get right sandwiches. And drive delivery parts couldn't turn around after I kind when out my way to get a bit to eat. But hop they put right one in the box the next time.
10266,0,3 years ago,1 star,"Always double-check your order when you get it. Be patient. So many irate customers here. It's unreal. If you come during a busy time, use the self-serve kisoks. I have never seen them open more than one register since the remodel. All of the excellent staff were let go when they rebuilt the store and didn't come back. This particular store is the best argument for a $20 minimum wage. Maybe if people earned more they might be more motivated or they could hire people who are enthusiastic."
10267,0,2 years ago,3 stars,"Worst Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich...chicken was like rubber.
Fries were fair.
Husband had 2 Cheeseburgers and they were not great either.
Coffee and hot mocha were good.
This McDonald's was beautiful inside. Looked just renovated."
10268,0,4 years ago,1 star,"We are frequent customers of this restaurant.  While the food was good, the inside was a mess!  Every garbage can was overflowing, with stacks of garbage piled up on all of them.  The tables were littered with paper and garbage. There were papers all over the floor, even by the register.  At the drink station, there were scattered cups and catsup splattered on the counter and floor.  Counter service was excruciatingly slow.  Since we really like the renovation and usually great service, we will probably give it one more shot.  We were there almost a half hour and so no one in the front cleaning.  Hopefully they can address and correct the problem."
10269,0,4 years ago,2 stars,"On the rare occasion my family stops here the order ALWAYS gets screwed up. More often than not it's the drive thru that screws up. The kiosk is cool and the game on a table is fun, but that in no way makes up for the lack of attention to orders. My rare visits will become even more rare."
10270,0,6 years ago,1 star,In a rush to get a lunch after 7 hours of work and the cashier takes an employee before me even  though I was next in line. No biggie until the employee orders something so messed up the cashier has to ask someone how to punch it in and then needs help again to give the employee the discount. I've never had a good experience at this McDonald's.
10271,0,2 years ago,2 stars,The service was okay today and the staff was friendly. I still had to pull up to wait for someone to bring out a simple order. This location is routinely slow in processing drive thru orders.  I'm talking 15 minutes or more. I wouldn't order anything there within an hour of closing. I was once served an Egg McMuffin on a biscuit with a folded egg. Some friends ordered 10 McFlurries and each cup was less than half full like they rationed it out.  This is probably one of the most disappointing and poorly run locations. You don't mind paying twice as much for a coffee at the Dunkin next door because the McDonald's is sooooo slow.
10272,0,11 months ago,2 stars,"Poor service, it took over 40 minutes for our food. The workers were more concerned with the drive thru. Nobody was working the front register or paying attention."
10273,0,a year ago,4 stars,I usually go there every morning but my order usually gets messed up at least once a week. with that being said they do replace my meal for free on the following visit.
10274,0,5 years ago,1 star,"Wow... This McDonald's is beyond awful. So many bad experiences!

For one, outside the place smells like a landfill. The inside is covered in flies and old decorations from months ago. Every table is dirty, the bathrooms are atrocious and the garbage is overflowing. If that were tolerable, the food certainly is it. There's always something wrong with the order or the food is old and stale or overcooked. We have had multiple issues with their soft drinks machine. Either the soda is warm, there is no carbonation or both. If someone suggests I go to this McDonald's again, I'll kindly tell them I'll eat my own foot after trouncing around in manure. There's no reason that cheap food has to be so lacking in quality."
10275,0,2 years ago,3 stars,Such in a hurry our double cheese burgers are horrible put together with hair on them. We threw them away. The ones we could eat made very sloppy. We eat McDonald's at least one time a week.
10276,0,2 years ago,1 star,"Horrible manager there , a woman by the name of Marsha I believe  or start with  an M i. I v Been waiting for the food for 15 mins and she tells me if I don't want to wait I should leave . How can a manager tells this? I am sure there is some sort of conduct policy or else she wouldn't been a manager"
10277,0,4 years ago,4 stars,"Stuff is super polite and nice and helpful. 4 stars because if you pay at a kiosk, grab a receipt and a table number, find a place, proudly install the number on top of it and wait you are sort of in a limbo: your order is not shown on any display, you have no clue when and how you will be served.
We waited for a good 20 min and then I just asked a very nice and polite servant if I did everything correctly and when we will be served. He said all is ok and they just have too many orders at this time but he said I will help.
Suggestion to the higher management.
All orders numbers have to be on one of the displays otherwise there are no feedback to the paid clients and with a less passionate clients you may have issues.
What is for sure is that this situation decreases efficiency of the floor workers since the current state of kiosk order processing creates a situation in which ppl will be asking questions that can easily be fixed by software upgrade!!
McCheers!!!

10279,0,9 months ago,1 star,It was horrible order from inside and it was a 27 min wait for food!! Ridiculous for 3 meals....
10280,0,4 years ago,5 stars,"Hello

I was stunned to read reviews of this location on Google.  Not our experience at all.

My wife and I both agree that this was the finest, cleanest, friendliest McDonalds we have ever been to ... dating back to the mid 1970's!  That's a lot of McDonalds all across Ontario, Quebec and probably 30 states in the USA.

We stopped on our way through for a quick bite at about 11:30 a.m. Thursday May 9 and again at about 1:30 p.m. Monday May 13.

We loved the staff, the patriotic decorations and just the overall welcoming atmosphere.

What a place.  Hope they keep it up!"
10281,0,5 years ago,1 star,Since their new building has opened it takes FOREVER to get your food! Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s supposed to be fast food and it takes 20-30 minutes in the drive through and then they gave my kids toddler toys when I did not ask 
10282,0,3 years ago,1 star,"Worst service in years. 10pm at night. Only car in the drive thru. 20 minutes for chicken tenders and fries. No explanation given. ""We are working on it"". The team's teenage friends inside however were getting personalized service with their coffees."
10283,0,4 years ago,1 star,This place has the worst service they kept giving us the wrong order and actually had his pay for someone else's. the area took a while to correct and then we still had to wait for our food for another 10 minutes or so. This was all done through the drive-thru and I expected better service the New York City from this place but I definitely didn't get it. the food actually wasn't that good either I remember feeling sick after I got home later so I definitely don't recommend going to this McDonald's.
10284,0,4 years ago,2 stars,"No one waits on you EVERYONE wants to help you order from the buy here pay here kiosk.  I want to order my food pay cash and have someone there so I don't have to wait 10 minutes for someone who has ignored the fact I have stood there 10 min, to show up and say May I help you. Ya you could have been here 10 minutes ago instead of standing in the corner with EVERYONE else running your mouth"
10285,0,2 years ago,1 star,"These people can't get an order straight to save their lives. We went in with an order that was WRITTEN DOWN CLEARLY and was very precise. 3 times we had to go back to the counter. The last time my sand which was dropped on the floor, picked up, wiped off, put in the container and handed to me! I got the entire incident captured on my phone and when I confronted the person, they denied my sandwhich even fell. This place is all around terrible. Save yourself the risk of salmonella poisoning and drive the 18 miles to Plattsburgh. Your health will thank you! I'd give zero stars if it were possible!!!!!!

.... 2/17/19....
Here We freaking go again! Tried one last time tonight, was very specific with our order (which wasn't very hard to begin with) and guess what? A complete and total failure! These people just don't Care! Do yourself A favor and drive the extra miles to Plattsburgh."
10286,0,3 years ago,4 stars,"Last stop before entering Canada! I recommend grabbing a bite here because one thing awaits you for sure for 1+hrs at the other side of the border: traffic. Grab a bite and if you're coming back from Canada, I think they accepted all of my Canadian change that I had left so that was convenient too."
10287,0,6 years ago,1 star,"This place seriously needs some funding from the head office to renovate and modernize the dinning area. Washrooms are deplorable. Considering the amount of Canadian traffic that passes through Champlain, I believe most would like a pit stop for lunch while traveling down to the states, a renovation would be warranted and I think most people would enjoy eating here more often."
10288,0,5 years ago,5 stars,"I only went in to use the bathroom and get a refreshment, but they were promoting ""Lobster Rolls!"" So I ordered one. One of the best Lobster Rolls I ever had! It was very tasty, and had plenty of lobster meat. Besides all of the lobster meat, my sandwich had the the full piece of meat from a claw!"
10289,0,7 years ago,4 stars,"Easy and clean  place to stop once you come back into the US  from the Canadian border.  The coffee is good and restroom is clean. Decour is a bit dated, but the food comes out fast and taste  the way it should."
10290,0,5 years ago,5 stars,"Coming from Quebec and it's 1pm, we stopped by for quick lunch. Burger was of course very good and the place is very modern but what surprised me was the great service. There was this McDonalds employee who was asking us if we need anything like soda refills or coffee. This is the first McDonalds that I experienced this great service. Go there folks!"
10291,0,a year ago,1 star,During a severe thunderstorm I told my son to pull over and get indoors. He was right near Mcdonalds in Champlain and he went in and ordered some food. After he got his food they kicked my son out and said he couldn't hang around due to covid right in the middle of the worst part of the storm. Use some common sense Mcdonalds and have a heart.
10292,0,a year ago,1 star,They took the fast out of fast food today! Always pull ahead at window 2. I remember when you use get your food from that window! If the machine breaks down we break down!
10293,0,3 years ago,3 stars,"Really same old same old. Once you've been to one, you've been to pretty much all of them. At least in Canada and the US anyways. This recently renovated location is clean and efficient the drive-thru is way faster than going inside."
10294,0,a year ago,1 star,Place was over crowded. Took 10 minutes to place order then another 20 minutes getting it just to not get my full order. I won't be back to this resturant.

10298,0,3 years ago,3 stars,"The man bathroom urinals stink so bad, the water does not flush the toxic substance in it. It gets busy when 2 buses pull in at the same time. The touch screen is not as easy to operate as most older people and many foreigners don't know how to place an order for the meal."
10299,0,3 years ago,1 star,"Extremely slow service, almost 30 minutes to get two cups of coffee, all staff was servicing drive thru and took the inside customers orders, but did not fill them. Not even a""sorry for the delay"". Manager told staff to stop taking orders"
10300,0,3 years ago,5 stars,One of the best mcdonalds I have been too. We travel from Montreal to New York frequently and often stop by this mcdonalds. The service is always efficient and quick. Premises always clean! Definitely a thumbs up especially considering how filthy and awful some other mcdonalds can be!!

10303,0,2 years ago,1 star,"Was asked to leave because the dining room was closed,
however there are no signs stating that the dining room was closed. This was after we ordered on the kiosk in the lobby that said nothing about the dining room being close as well. The food was poorly prepared it was a mess."
10304,0,4 years ago,2 stars,They force you to order from a kiosk while employees just stand around.  In fact the busiest person there was the one telling people to use the kiosks to order.  I had to ask three times for my drink cup.
10305,0,6 years ago,1 star,"Lacking in customer service.  Wouldn't substitute steak for sausage in big breakfast. Even after we said we would pay extra. Biscuits were hard. Bathroom was nasty!
Only good thing worth the one star was the coffee!!"

10307,0,9 months ago,1 star,Tired of getting cold half filled frys! They would not serve half a tea! Why serve half a fry!
10308,0,a year ago,1 star,This is the worst McDonald's ever.they are very slow.they screw up our order every time we go there.we are done with this place.today I asked for 2 hamburgers I got 2 cheeseburgers.wth.we are always asking for our cup for our soda.at times we could stand there for more than 10 min.before being waited on.never again.
10309,0,4 years ago,4 stars,"The foods always good here but the waiting time sucked. Its like nobody in there wanted to work this night. Almost 10 minutes waiting for simple orders, and it was at the end and it wasn't packed. Smh"
10310,0,a year ago,2 stars,Was ok food usually gets messed up and sometimes not so tasty at this McDonald's I used to go their all the time when I first moved up here but every single time I went their messed my order up and the food was mostly gross some is ok but not as good as other McDonald's
10311,0,5 years ago,1 star,They don't listen. They gave us really cold fry's. The Dr. Pepper was flat. The manger was very rude. I ask for light lettuce and extra sauce on my big mac. And they put big load of lettuce and very little sauce. THEY DONT LISTEN!!!!!
10312,0,5 years ago,5 stars,"Who rates McDonalds?! Well, this one is worth rating. Fresh flowers at the tables, a greeter, super clean, table delivery, friendly staff, classy interior (yes, better than other mcds...). Nice job at this location! Impressed!"
10313,0,3 years ago,4 stars,"Drive-thru can be very slow. Your better off to go in, order on the kiosk, then leave with your food if you don't want to dine in. The food is comparable to other McDonald's franchises I've been to."
10314,0,6 years ago,1 star,"Absolutely awful, get your stuff together McDonalds. Yes, their food tastes good but the place it's self is horrid. If you are in a rush which most of us are since it's fast food, don't come to this one. Without a doubt they will get your order completely wrong. They have literally messed up my order 3 times in this past week. I order iced peppermint coffee, and they never give it to me even though it says it on my receipt, it';s always hot coffee they give me. One of the orders messed up my coffee so bad that it was just a hot coffee with just creamer in it, no sugar or flavor(even though I asked for iced peppermint mocha). I ordered 2 pies and they didn't even give me them, plus picante sauce comes with the breakfast burritos yet they never give me it either. Mess up my McChicken just about every time I order it. This happens very often but this time it threw me over the edge since it was so frequent this week. Champlain's McDonalds is the worse by far that I have been to."
10315,0,4 years ago,1 star,Was going through and the family decided we should get McDonald's seeing how we were about 30minutes till they closed was gonna just get something small went to the drive thru and no one answered pulled to the front and saw about 5 people just looking at us weird then turning to each other and laughing.. not satisfied with them at all

10319,0,4 years ago,4 stars,It's one of the most techi mcdonalds out there.  However it does occasionally take more than a few minutes to get your food in the drive through on a busy day.  You're better off to go in an order from the kiosk and sit at the tables.  They all have flowers on them.
10320,0,2 years ago,4 stars,It was backed up after baseball and bcuz a bunch of electrical workers came in off of 87. But after just a few minutes wait the drive thru started working very rapidly.
10321,0,4 years ago,3 stars,"Update... Was in hurry and tried this McD's again. Huge improvement from past experience. Food was hot, seemed fresh for fast food. Raised one star... With raise again if next visit consistent.

Past review...
New bulding... same substandard food. They must get corporate McDonald leftovers. Not sure why the fries and burgers taste awful compared to other McDs. Cold wilty fries and the hambuger pattes looked worse than most. Hoped the new building would have improved food. Got a green quarter pounder patty last visit in old building. Disappointed, do not like going to Plattsburgh if can help it. maybe try again in a year. hopefully better experience then."
10322,0,2 years ago,5 stars,"A good McDonalds location. Placed an in app order for drive thru pick up. All went well, quickly and correctly fulfilled. Staff was friendly. Thumbs up!"

Paid with 2 gift cards and 10 dollars cash for my meal, you would think I would get change back, but she hands me back a gift card. Tells me the change is on the card.

10325,0,4 years ago,1 star,"The McDonald's in Champlain NY is a great place to grab something to eat and to be honest I just came here last night on my way to Altona to play the slot machines and I really enjoy coming to this McDonald's and it's way far better than the one is in my town where I live and it's like Night And Day compared to this one and I just as well give this place a 5 Star Rating and the other one is a 1 Star Rating and if I had the opportunity to give it a BIG FAT ZERO I REALLY WOULD AND I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO REVIEWER'S TO HAVE TO GIVE IT A 1 STAR WHEN THEY DON'T DESERVE IT?????

This McDonald's here in Swanton VT is probably the worst place to get so called fast food! I go through the drive thru too order my food, but before I do go too McDonald's I always make sure that I have a full tank of gas in my car. Because by the time I get my food, I've already waisted at least 15 bucks in gas by the time I leave this place. I believe that if it's going too take a half hour or more to finally get my very Luke Warm Garbage then this McDonald's should not be allowed to call themselves a part of the Fast Food Chain! If you want to get something quick to eat, then don't go to this McDonald's here in Swanton and their service is terrible and the food is even worse!"

10331,0,5 years ago,5 stars,"We Canadians get so much less than USA McD's.  I don't even bother going to Canadian outlets unless it was for the $1.00 coffee. Here, everything was done as McD would want...AND served to your table another difference between the two."
10332,0,3 years ago,4 stars,This place doesn't serve McLobster roll anymore.  We used to go there twice a summer for their lobster roll.  I gave a 4 stars became of the interior quality.

10344,0,4 years ago,2 stars,I dont want to use a computer to place my own orders. I order a sandwich without things that come on it and special drinks. But then the cashier can't get my order right either
10345,0,2 years ago,1 star,I'm parked at Maplefields store. I walked up to McDonalds. I ordered a bacon sandwich. Instead I get a deluxe qtr cheese. This always happens. This is why I go to Wendy's.
10346,0,6 years ago,3 stars,"Service is fast and the food is well. ..McDonalds.  Decor needs an update.
Staff is very nice and friendly.
Very popular with Canadians traveling to the USA."
10347,0,4 years ago,3 stars,Waited 10 minutes for my order to be ready via drive thru. They forgot to put a hamburger party on one of my custom order cheese burgers... So essentially I had a cheese sandwich
10348,0,4 years ago,1 star,"Food was cold. Asked for no pickles, got pickles. Fries were stale and we waited 10 minutes for the food. Why was it cold if we had to wait? Only reason we stopped was there was no where else to go."

Edit: after weeks of ordering there, they always do mistakes on every other order!"
10350,0,4 years ago,4 stars,It's no longer a cheap meal ours usually for two people cost around 20 bucks but the coffee is good and we know that the food is always to a certain standard which is very important when we're traveling on the highway and we don't know the restaurants.

A short line to order my small drink and fry, restroom is for customers, and get the code for the door. To my surprise, the restroom was stocked and clean. When I exited, I looked around and noticed how clean the rest of the area was. Maybe because so few of us dine in nowadays.  I know how hard cleanliness can be to achieve and maintain in this industry, so 5 stars to them. Best $5 pit stop ever, and I can not say the same for the coffee shop chain I frequent."
10821,23,a month ago,1 star,"Ive gone to this location several times. And today was by far the most unpleasant visit I've had. It was just the absolute worst! I'm taking my Son to work and decide to stop and get him lunch, and as soon as I'm ordering through  the intercom , I can already tell the demeanor of the worker was comming off pretty rude.  Once. We approached the window , when I gave her my code for my McDonald's Rewards she right away got even more rude with her whole body and facial expressions and didn't want to take my code , but in a very bad mood overall. Her attitude was so unpleasant. Being a McDonald's customer for years, I Didn't appreciate her behavior , she just ruined my whole mood and day. Her manager came to explain to me the situation in a much calmer , respectful manner. I mean, thats all Griselda had to do. Employees like this need to get trained better on how to properly interact with customers. Once you're clocked in, you're clocked in and should be ready to go. Trust me. I know. I've worked in customer service for 18 years. So I hope this McDonald's location properly trains Griselda accordingly."

Waited about 15 minutes for a sausage egg mcmuffin and small OJ. Several customers were waiting inside. At one point, the only cashier at the front walked away for about 5 minutes. Customers coming in and asking for help but no one came out. Finally got my order and it was barely warm. OJ had something floating around in it but I was already running behind so I just threw it away on my way out. Never going back to this one."
10824,23,a year ago,1 star,I would  Give this McDonald's 0 stars if I could they don't only forget your sauces for your nuggets but they give you a Burger with a paper still on the Patty cooked with cheese on it. I bit into my Burger and I chewed it right away I tasted the paper.. Took my Burger apart and found the paper that's on the Burger Patty before it's cooked . Be more careful. People could get sick if they eat that.  It would be nice if I could get my money back for this.

10835,23,4 years ago,1 star,"I'd give it a ZERO if I could. From the time I pulled in until the time I was handed I drink through the first window, I waited 22 minutes. I finally got so frustrated because nothing that I honked my horn to get their attention. When they realize that all I had was a drink she handed it to me through the first window and I drove around the people that were still waiting. It was a horrible experience! This is definitely not a place to go if you're looking for fast food. I could have done better with a local diner.
On top of that it was the worst tasting sweet tea I had ever tasted. There was hardly any ice so it was warm, it was mostly water and the flavor was like a mixture of regular tea and watered down sweet tea.
I can honestly say this is the worst McDonald's I have ever driven through.

10839,23,8 months ago,1 star,"On 10/04/2022, at approximately 12:55 p.m., i ordered my food through the mobile order app. I entered curbside 5. After 15 minutes of no food being delivered, I walked into the store. I spoke to a manager and she told me my food was outside. I went outside, my food was no where. I went back into the store, i asked one of the curbside deliverers if I could please have my food as my lunch break was about to expire and I was going to be late. She stated she would check on my order. However, she had time to walk out with another gentleman that works at the Mcdonalds, walk outside, and give a good bye kiss. When I finally received my order 25 minutes later (1:15 p.m.), the bread on the big mac was soggy and my fries were now stale. Last to say, I ended up throwing away half of my big mac and all of my fries. This store needs a lot of help from corporate. A few weeks ago i bought 4 deluxe breakfast's over the weekend for the family and they gave me no syrup. Luckily I had syrup at home. Anyway, it'll be the last time I ever purchase anything at this store. I should have gone to jack in the box across the street."

10874,23,5 years ago,1 star,"Usually the lane in this location is crazy long but we thought we got lucky today because the lane was short. We placed our order and drove to the window to pay. We waited for about 3 minutes to be acknowledged. A young lady with a yellow shirt possibly a manager was facing her back to the window and she talked to the cashier. It took for me to honk in order for her to open the window to take my payment. Not once did she say anything to us. Not a greet nor an apology. Just took my credit card and gave me my receipt. I drove to the next window where another young girl was. She gave me my food and I asked her if the lady in the yellow shirt was a manager and she said yes. I then asked her for her name and she has the nerve to say "" I actually don't know her name I just got back but I'll ask"". What??? How do you not know who the manager on duty is. I left. The service was extremely poor for no reason at all. I ordered 2 happy meals and a nd chicken. I think that's an easy order. Horrible service. The manager did not look happy. As a matter of fact she seemed unhappy. She chose to work retail and chose to be a manager."
10875,23,5 years ago,5 stars,This is a nice location to go and grab a quick meal or snack. The lines are not usually that long and the restaurant itself is usually very clean and comfortable. We often go there. I definitely recommend this location to anyone who likes McDonald's. The prices of course are also very reasonable and the turnaround time is usually very fast. Two thumbs up.

I waited another 10 minutes and like 3 people came out and asking what my order was and the manager said oh an egg McGriddle like no...where did i say anything about eggs in my sandwhich and that took more time. It took 4 people to get the order right. Not to mention the wait. And on other days i come here the drive thru wait time is 20 min to 1hr.

She wasn't very friendly. I gave her a good morning and a smile. I don't remember if I got a good morning back, but definitely didn't get anything close to a smile. It is opening and the place is filthy, from the floor to the tables to the restroom. Whoever closed the night before didn't even wipe the tables, so it's a bit understandable why she is irritated or whatever, but lady I'm not the one who left it like that so give me the smile you are paid to give me. It's literally your job. Plus smiling releases hormones that make you feel better. Thanks.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"

10913,23,a year ago,1 star,"Make sure to check that got your order because they are always either missing my burgers, fries, or sauces. Not sure how when all they have to do is read the screen."
10914,23,2 years ago,4 stars,"Daughter wanted the Travis Scott burger. She says it's a hit or miss with her friends. I ordered the newly freeze drink which gave me an adult ""brain freeze"" and it wasn't as sweet like the Icee back in the day. I wouldn't order it again."
10915,23,a year ago,1 star,Bro it was very badd service! It took 10-12 minutes in the drive thru just sitting for an order of 1 large iced tea And minute maid freezy
10916,23,5 years ago,1 star,"I usually order McDonalds through the drive thru, but the line was very long so I decided to order inside since there was no line. Now I see why everyone orders at the drive thru.

It smelled really bad inside (like a restroom) and the ceiling was leaking behind the food service line which makes me question the quality of the food. On top of that there were homeless people lingering around. One asked me for money TWICE. Once before I ordered and once afterwards. The cashier also didn't know what she was doing, she kept asking the manager for help making service slow.

I would not recommend this McDonalds AT ALL."
10917,23,4 years ago,1 star,It took 30 minutes to get my food the frys where cold so I had them make me some more which took extra time. I do not recommend stopping at this McDonalds for any reason. They also didn't have all the ingredients for my sandwich

The Filet O Fish with the humongous glob of tartar sauce that slides out (NO matter how hard you try) all over your shirt while you're driving.  One of my favorites.   As a favorite,  I feel I shouldn't have to--wait for for it...."
10919,23,4 years ago,1 star,"Do not go to this Mc Donald's!!! It took over 20mins to get my food! I went to use the rest room with my kids and there is a homeless man washing his underwear in the sink! Then as we were looking for a table, there were people sleeping in the seats! The place was dirty, but the workers were nice. Over-all I would recommend the you pass this eatery by!! And confronted by gang members as I was leaving with my kids!!"

Having to pay and not receiving your complete order especially the main meal is unsatisfactory... Never coming to this Mc Donald's"
10926,23,5 years ago,1 star,Orders are being handed out not in sequence the cashier was excellent but the assistant in the light blue shirt who did not have a name badge and wouldn't write down her name for me was not the nicest person for your establishment if it was up to me and I knew she was going to be there I would not show up to your establishment ther just letting you know but your cashier was very good in taking orders the handout you need a lot of help there thank you and have a blessed day

10930,23,4 years ago,1 star,Don't ever come though the drive through. It takes so long to get your food. I'm waiting 30 mins and I can't even get out of here. I'm stuck in between cars. Please avoid this place and drive another 10 mins to the next McDonald's. Trust me it'll be a lot faster than ordering food here.
10931,23,3 years ago,5 stars,"Don't really appreciate this part of town... But, when I crave McDonald's. I drive 21 miles one way, because they serve the best big Macs I've had. It truly is delicious."

10933,23,2 years ago,4 stars,This location is much better since they got dual drive thru lanes; it's much faster and efficient now. Sidenote: they never have salads!
10934,23,2 years ago,1 star,McDonalds aint been the same since the end of 2011 when I noticed they went down hill and continue to slide to the bottom. Only people born in the 90's on back know how McDonlds use to be. They food is garbage. All fake and tasteless
10935,23,7 years ago,2 stars,"Slow service, bad area after hours, not very safe to eat in, recommend drive through. the food is consistent for the most part. the staff is ok but can be better. getting in and out can be cumbersome. not the best place for a date or families. It's ideal for a quick stop and go only."
10936,23,6 years ago,1 star,"Slowest service ever. Order was cold and incomplete. Oatmeal was just a mush with the fruits separate. Pancakes had no butter or syrup. The eggs in the sandwich was burnt and cheese was not even melted. HORRIBLE, AVOID THIS LOCATION."

10940,23,5 years ago,1 star,"Very bad service, Employees were so rude not only to me but to others. They had 5 workers 1 lady in the back cooking 1 young girl taking orders and 3 workers on one phone laughing. When my daughter finally got her meal her food was literally just toss to her."

Any ways this place needs help

10948,23,4 years ago,1 star,"I wouldn't recommend McDonalds food to anyone for what should be obvious reasons . Stopping there was not my idea. Although, charging only a BUCK for a large soft drink was avery, very, very SMART move.  I'm sure millions go in to purchase a pop/soda & end up spending maybe on average say $5.00"
10949,23,4 years ago,1 star,"It was the worst! I ordered my food from the machine I paid at 1:31pm at 2:00 i was just getting my food and i was quite upset everyone there was upset once i spoke to the manager she was no help they only had one person making the food, and from where I was standing they were only giving the food to the drive through customer.

So I received my food and the fries were cold and I ask for fresh food, so they took the cold fries and I waited again when CDC the manage gave me a new bag I thought the order was correct I made it to my car and I went to eat some of my fries and it was a small fries and it had a toy in the bag, so now I am so mad I just drove off and I called and let them know and the lady that answered she told lj e to bring my recipe and they would take care of it.

11298,11,3 months ago,5 stars,"There's nothing like eating a spicy Mc chicken at the legendary pier.
The prices are good (as always). I highly recommend the dollar menu, in this case, 2 Mc chickens for only $4. The taste is very good! For the price of course. And the spicy one tastes even better. Service was very fast, but it can get very packed in the afternoon. Plenty of seats and restrooms are available as well (it gets packed, too). Pickup available. The everyday McDonald's, but placed in a crowded and convenient spot. We highly recommend spicy Mc chicken with extra buffalo sauce!"
11299,11,2 months ago,4 stars,"I don't eat at McDonald's, but I do UberEats deliveries. I love this McDonald's because it has a parking structure in an area that typically doesn't have one. This makes it very convenient for me and people who choose to eat there."
11300,11,2 weeks ago,1 star,"4 consecutive weeks, Every Monday the dining room is not swept or mopped. They don't open at 530am. For the last month on Mondays they won't have orange juice. They say the machine doesn't work and they can't serve it. The cashier tells me Some other worker will squeeze the orange because it's freshly squeezed. I would understand one mistake, but it's occurring every Monday."
11301,11,a month ago,1 star,"My daughter, her friends and i was at this particular McDonalds while visiting the boardwalk (out of town visitors). There was roaches all over the place and they were big. The place was not clean. Homeless people surrounded the place.  I will never go back and i have already told a lot of people that were headed that way."
11302,11,2 months ago,3 stars,"What a unique McDonald's, love the structure. But, the only reason that why it's a low rating for me is because they sometimes get people order wrong. That's the only reason I have. Also this place is sometimes very crowded and busy."

11304,11,3 years ago,4 stars,"It is just minutes away from the pier, many homeless people inside and you should take good care of your belongings. It is clean but employees barely smile and cold due to holiday working hours I guess :)) Had the double burger cheese and oats meal which I do not complain. It is thanks giving holiday."
11305,11,2 months ago,2 stars,"Waited in line for half an hour, and it seemed like forever at the pick-up window.  I asked if they were short staffed, and she said they were waiting on the fries. But when I got them they were cold. She offered no explanation until I got tired of waiting"
11306,11,2 weeks ago,2 stars,"this McDonald's is more expensive than others in the area, and be warned that individuals in their garage are very sensitive to the fact if you have your phone out and become vocallyworried that you are taking pictures or video of them."
11307,11,a year ago,4 stars,The Santa Monica location is on par with most McDonald's out there. The food was satisfactory and the speed of service was reasonable. My only problems with the experience were the restaurant was incredibly busy and the smell of pot was pretty strong from someone smoking it out on the patio. They had the munchies I guess.
11308,11,3 months ago,2 stars,"Frequently at this location, someone is spewing toxic gases into the air, violating local laws (& humane rights; despite a security guard on site).
Cashiers are expected to be able to actually perform elementary subtraction, such as 12-7=5; (because the US doesn't mint 3 dollar bills) and I already have enough singles to stuff Magic Mike's g-string.
If this location has take out hours & dining room hours, that should be posted; on entry ways & online. Otherwise, we patrons expect to sit down, not be told the seating area is closed 30 minutes prior to closing and 20+ minutes after opening. MGMT should schedule site & employee hours accordingly."

11310,11,3 months ago,4 stars,Look the staff here is great despite the unwanted obvious nuisance. Food is prepped fast and staff are professional. Restroom are actually kept clean again despite certain unfortunate citizens. I always take out from here and go to the beach. Or park my car at the very top of the lot and eat there.
11311,11,5 months ago,4 stars,"It's McDonald's...by the pier.  McDonald's. In the wee hours (only time I go) it can be colorful with the occasional altercation/conflict, but they have security.  Never had a issue there.  Order my food from the kiosk, wait, p/u, eat while I walk home and later wish that I didn't order 3 to 4 sandwiches."

This particular location is also right down the street from Santa Monica Pier. A great place to eat before going to the beach!
11314,11,4 years ago,5 stars,"Everytime I go into the Santa Monica McDonald's, it able to handle the busy times. In my opinion consider the customer traffic, however they waist no time getting orders, if you do not have a cloud following, then you should get what you want. Bathrooms have intermittent traffic depending on the busy time. I see they want you to enjoy your meal, in my opinion. In the pictures you will available seating at a perfect time. I was satisfied!"

11326,11,10 months ago,5 stars,"No drive thru, enough parking. Crowded but fairly quick. They had the front doors open and I could feel the air moving, not stuffy. Mask optional at the time (July/28/22). All employees were wearing masks. All employees were pleasant or acceptably neutral and doing a good job. Bathrooms and tables clean.  Floors looked pretty good too considering the large amount of foot traffic. Indoor and outdoor tables. Whenever someone got up, a worker appeared shortly after to spray and wipe down the table. In person you can order at  cashiers or use one of the 8 self-service screens. I believe you could also order through the app. There's a scanner at the bottom of the payment pinpad.
Didn't have to wait very long for my food. Less than 5 minutes."

11333,11,5 years ago,4 stars,"To be honest, I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky D's for its coffee. I have to wake up pretty early, so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at 5am. With that being said, I will also say that because of Santa Monica's influx of homelessness over the years, this particular location gets alot of homeless patrons. Most are nice, and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to time; however, it's the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel troublesome. The staff tries to placate situations, but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more everyday. So, if you can't handle, talk, be patient, and react positively to people who are just trying to get through the day, the don't go here. I don't need you screaming and being annoyed at every little thing. Bye!!"
11334,11,8 months ago,2 stars,"Full of homeless people not like I'm unaware of our global situation with homelessness, but if you looking to sit down chill and eat don't do it at this one. It doesn't have a drive thru, so order ahead for pick up, it does have self service ordering kiosk."

Do note, that workers can sometimes be very stingy or serious due to the large amount of people that come in daily (this McDonalds in particular gets very packed). So please be kind to them, they are trying their best to get your food served! <3"

11361,11,2 years ago,4 stars,"The only reason I am giving this location for stars instead of 5 is because overall, I don't eat McDonald's or fast food. However, the one day that I did go to Santa Monica, I just had a sudden craving for something fatty and sugary.

I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very clean. The staff there were also very hospitable, friendly, and alert. I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced tea, and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to eat.

Out there was just as clean as it was on the inside. I haven't had McDonald's since 2012, so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste it.

Everything was okay okay with me."

Open your mind and empty your heart of fears so that you can know and experience God to the fullest. Lord, You are my peace, my assurance and the love that I hold on to.Reach higher than you think possible for all that you want and you find that often you attain even more. Lord, I rely on Your promises made to each of us and especially on Your love.
Be patient with others, but mostly be patient with yourself. Lord, help me to keep a smile on my face and to realize my goodness and refuse to dwell on my imperfections.Desiring more and more without appreciating what you have right now will never allow you to be truly happy. Be grateful for the gifts you are receiving right this very minute. That's happiness!God gives abundantly to those who pass His gifts on to others. Lord, let Your blessings flow in to me and then out from me. I will neither be selfish nor let my gifts stagnate.
Use Jesus' as your example on how to live. Lord, You will guide and advise us and then You will leave it to us to decide our own future. Give us wisdom in our choices.Dear Lord, thank you for being such a loving God and caring about our pain. You don't want to see us suffer. You know the suffering that we face, and I ask that you would please redeem it and bring it to an end. In the midst, Lord, I believe that you are sufficient. I ask that your strength will be made perfect in our weakness. In Jesus's name, amen"

11371,11,3 years ago,3 stars,"The new renovation it went through makes it look more modern! The ordering kiosks are perfect for the tourist that can't speak English or Spanish. It is very spacious! Please beware, not to their fault, the Homeless population can be a turn off to go their do to the fact that it's a hang out spot for them. I have no problem with that as long as they mind their own business and I do the same. One thing that I'm surprised about, No refills on my coffee? Really? That was one of the main reasons I went there for breakfast. Besides that, it's McDonald's we are taking about. Quick and easy meal compare to other higher price options around."

I ordered a sundae for my mom and after 10 minutes of waiting, I saw one employee feel a tear in her pants below her butt and then she went and fixed herself a sundae and left. At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered 20 minutes prior. I was given a refund without fuss before leaving. The bad part to all of this was there were about 12 people working at the location during my visit which was more than enough to prepare and delivery the food quickly."

11375,11,3 years ago,4 stars,"Very nice, very clean.
Saw a guy come in who ""looked"" homeless and 2 security guards immediately swarmed in and ushered him out. It was kind of impressive, yet I felt so sorry for the guy and thought security should have been more sensitive when doing the job because the man clearly wasn't all there.

Also, the men's rest room was very clean, however I'd prefer paper towels on hand in addition the the blowers. I had to touch the press down facet button and I had to touch the soup dispenser. I like to use paper towels to touch these things... especially the door when leaving..."

Minutes later I return one item was made wrong!
Same black lady asked her staff to fix it then she gave it to me without checking it and I find out that they did it wrong again! I took to her for the third time and then she asked her staff again to do it again!
Instead of making sure itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s done correct!

11377,11,2 weeks ago,5 stars,Santa Monica pier is a few steps from here.
11378,11,3 years ago,5 stars,Wonderful beachside McDonald's on Santa Monica Beach... food is excellent and the restroom is open to the public until 11 p.m.
11379,11,6 days ago,4 stars,Fine it's always busy place
11380,11,4 years ago,4 stars,Good McD centrally located and quick service.
11381,11,3 years ago,5 stars,We usually go mainly for the soft serve covers and sundaes.  Nothing hits the spot on a hot day like a small sundae.  Prices are perfect and the kids really appreciate the treat.  Hot fudge on the bottom really makes it fun for them.
11382,11,5 years ago,3 stars,"I usually give high reviews but not this time. The service is excellent. Fast and professional staff all the way. Truely representing McDonald's culture. Unfortunately there is an issue with homeless people that brings this location down. The restroom has a bad odor because of the homeless people washing up in there. The restroom door doesn't close as to see what's going on in there such as drug use I can only speculate. There are plenty of homeless people going in and out of the establishment to eat and use the restroom. So they carry a bad odor. It ruins the atmosphere. It's depressing. I witnessed a homeless man get hauled out by Santa Monica Police for lounging around, not purchasing any food, and being loud and unruly. I applaud the quick response of the security officer on duty who immediately asked the man to leave several times always maintaining his composure, even as the homeless man escalated. It's a tough job, but it's getting done. The priorities are kept here. Customer satisfaction and safety are key to the staff and it shows."
11383,11,2 years ago,4 stars,"Convenient location and although there are some challenges the area faces (homeless and everything that goes with that), the restaurant does a good job keeping things clean, service helpful, and food good as always. We had an order with a lot of custom requests for kids (no this, extra that), and each burger was put together exactly as ordered."
11384,11,6 years ago,3 stars,Bathrooms are very dirty and lines are very poorly organized. I was able to skip ahead of at least ten people that were ahead of me because they don't communicate the registers that are open to the customers. The booths in the far side of the restaurant smell like cigarettes. Food was served quickly and with good quality however.
11385,11,a year ago,1 star,So overall they usually have one of the fastest services especially when it comes to McDonald's in regards to what I'm doing doordash. Only problem being at this location is a hub for intoxicated panhandling homeless people.
11386,11,2 years ago,2 stars,"The People Who Work There Were Very Rude&Short In Response.
There Parking Garage Is Hazardous!!"
11387,11,3 years ago,4 stars,"No different than any other McDonalds, except that it's in Santa Monica very close to the pier and beach. It's surprisingly well kept and clean and very fast. Lots of tourists and visitors and the location is updated with the order kiosk systems so can get moving pretty fast. Seating can be an issue on very crowded days. Over all good experience and not too bad."
11388,11,a month ago,5 stars,One of the nicest mc donalds
11389,11,a year ago,1 star,"Really rude staff, too bad service. Avoid if you can. There are so many other better places to eat or drink around.
They would literally cheat you!"
11390,11,3 years ago,1 star,"Too many homeless people that kept walking in and out of this location, we couldn't eat comfortably because they smelled so bad as they passed by. I understand they can't help it due to their situation but if you have a hard time tolerating body odor of various homeless people walking back and forth in this McDonald's location then you should definitely avoid this location."
11391,11,5 years ago,3 stars,This is a very convenient location. Probably the most affordable food in this area near the pier. It's usually very busy with foot traffic for the beach and the promenade. You will encounter all types from international tourist to local bums. It's fairly clean considering the large amount of customers. The orders are quick but be sure to check it before leaving. Not the most accurate employees
11392,11,a year ago,3 stars,"This McDonald tourist city attraction restaurant is over rated by it's local customers.  During my visit to this restaurant, none of its employees had people skills or customer dissatisfaction resolution skills.  Its employees escalated its customers verbal complaints to verbal challenging arguments.  Without any complaint resolution."
11393,11,a year ago,3 stars,"Food was good, jt was crowded, there was gum in my chair, didnt notice til i got up and it was all over my shorts"
11394,11,4 years ago,1 star,"This plave is not a good place. They used to have blacks there too. Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled. All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race. I though McDonald's was equal opportunity employer. Guess not. Today I went there to use the restroom. I was told I couldn't use the restroom unless I bought something. I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way. I asked to speak to the manager, the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something. I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency I'll be in and out that's all I need it and I was still denied. Every time I come to this place is always something. Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait 20 to 30 minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her. I wasn't really strong with expressing myself oh, now I express myself a little bit more. I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isn't a nice place to be I wouldn't give them a dime of my money. When did they treat people and I've always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonald's along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonald's down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English. Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen. The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty, disrespectful, unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California. Let's get back together McDonald's or else I'll go to the next level and bringing all these customers that also it's like this McDonald's. We even go one more step above and bring the in all your future customers who have never been there before just to mention on how they've had experiences at McDonald's that were so exceptionally great and then compare it to the way that you treat all the customers who've walked out of McDonald's and see if they'll never come back I don't think we want this to be a topic of discussion."
11395,11,2 years ago,1 star,I ordered from here twice and I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and onions and the first time they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t even put the bacon on it (The bacon that I spend my money on) and now they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t put the onion on it.
11396,11,5 years ago,4 stars,"They always have a lot of staff in hand, specially on the week ends and at peak hours. You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the pier. This also means that there will be homeless there as well. I like to live and let live so I don't mind sharing space with my fellow man. With that said there is security at hand at all times. Even when this place looks crowded the service is fast and like most McDonald's with a smile. You get something to eat at a great price in a perfect location."
11397,11,5 months ago,1 star,"Very bad exp, I believe I goten bad food."
11398,11,5 months ago,5 stars,They got the best breakfast here.
11399,11,4 years ago,4 stars,"They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we cancelled, and they also gave us the actual orders we bought. All in all they were pretty fast workers. They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica Pier. I understand that it's not always going to be clean there because, frankly, there's not much room to clean there most of the time. If I could give 4.2 stars, I would."
11400,11,4 years ago,4 stars,"We ate breakfast here every morning while staying at a hotel around the corner. The food was always made correct and fresh, however the large amount of homeless people hanging out make things a little more difficult.  (No condiments are self serve,  the security guard has to let you into the bathroom, sometimes hard to find a table)"
11401,11,2 years ago,4 stars,"I just had a large fry it was okay the kids had hamburger happy meals, the burgers were cold and ""tasted funny"", they ate the fries, and of course really liked the toy inside. 7 out of 10 today mediocre."
11402,11,a year ago,3 stars,It is an OK place to go if you do not have a better option. The prices and the quality of the food are reasonable
11403,11,5 years ago,3 stars,Great food and staff but the crowd is a bit sketchy
11404,11,10 months ago,1 star,"if you're a tourist DON'T go to McDonald's especially this one, rude service, poor choice, worst fast food chain in US by far"
11405,11,3 years ago,4 stars,It was crowded! Unfortunately they don't do refills here.
11406,11,4 years ago,1 star,No dollar menu anything but drinks here! Even coffee is 2 bucks! The service is spotty and confusing at best! The place is small and serves the end of the busiest street that leads to the pier....ultra poor planning on space for quality of service/business. There are a lot kf vagrants at this location but they are for the most part harmless.
11407,11,a year ago,2 stars,They allow the homeless to beg in front of their door and people buy them food so they go inside and eat. The problem is their smell!!! We bring our tourists families and end up totally embarrassed.
11408,11,5 years ago,2 stars,"Manager sucks. I called her over for help and she ignored me. Seating arrangements are disorganized. The soda fountain machine is always dirty. Hardly any ice. When you press for a certain soda, it runs water for a while. Too many homeless people. The only decent thing here is the food."
11409,11,2 years ago,1 star,"Worst McDonald's in the world, that's a big statement but its the only one that fits.
I ordered breakfast on a Saturday. It wasn't too busy but when I got my food I was missing some sandwiches, my pancakes were super cold like if they had just defrosted them and put them in my bag and the hashbrowns were literally stuck to the wrapper and the bag they came in looked like it had been dunked in the deep frier.

Save your money, go eat somewhere else where the food is actually edible.
To clarify I'm not bagging on all McDonald's, I quite like the food BUT this location is terrible, my suggestion is to go elsewhere"
11410,11,2 years ago,4 stars,The service is fast but since the pandemic it seems that the mask is the most important thing.. security is polite and the Cusomer service associates are kinda formal but still polite...you can eat on the patio but not for long...
11411,11,4 years ago,4 stars,"It's McDonald's, cheap sustenance to keep on going. We had a couple burgers and fries and I can't complain they were alright when the price is taken into account. It can be quite busy at times so keep this in mind when going at peak times. The restaurant itself was pretty clean, what you come to expect from a McDonald's."
11412,11,4 years ago,1 star,Got my order wrong took forever to serve my sweet tea. Crispy chicken had a large piece of not so crispy chicken w/ the foulest tasting sauce I'll never order again  watered down sodas so much you'd think it was club soda. Never again
11413,11,4 years ago,1 star,We asked for a cup of water after we were done eating our food inside. Lady said we needed to purchase until she seen my orange juice cup.. she then proceeded to give us a tiny cup. What exactly were we supposed to do with that? Meanwhile others got a decent sized cup for water. What do you lose to give out a cup of WATER?

Even so, I still donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t understand"
11415,11,4 years ago,2 stars,"I expect crowding because it's close to the beach. The ice machine is always out, they don't have enough fresh brewed tea to refill the container, and some of the employees have attitude. The security guard tends to trip, but it's not always the same guard. Service is pretty fast considering the volume of customers. I only go there because of proximity."

11419,11,5 years ago,5 stars,Great place to eat by the beach without the ridiculous prices . Beware that many homeless people ask you for change but never wanna change the sense of direction his life is unnerving to give people money as they bother while consuming meat patties between buns of bread with seeds. Moral of this review is to never help homeless while eating
11420,11,4 years ago,5 stars,"Gets very very busy , but they are normally fairly rapid about getting everyone through. By far the cheapest food place in that area, so ideal if you're just visiting. It's still McDonalds though so don't expect anything different from every other franchise."

Parking lot entrance smelled like Pee, and the Patio tables were disgusting to the point I had to clean it myself and I STILL didnt want to touch it. And the patio chairs were so Uncomfortable aswell"
11425,11,3 years ago,5 stars,This place is a major tourist hub as it is located within a few blocks from the Santa Monica Pier. Inside is nice. They will also bring food to you that you won't see in any other store or this may be new to me since I have been to Mcdonald's only a few times in my entire life.
11426,11,2 months ago,2 stars,Loads of homeless people around
11427,11,a year ago,4 stars,It's a McDonald's it didn't disappoint. I got another one supersize. And that's what I wanted. Fade Out on the floor back back back to get a bag over there balcony. Exactly what I wanted no surprises.

11431,11,5 years ago,1 star,"Go anywhere else. Not here. Beyond the counter, this place is never clean.  Glorified truck stop.  Too many other options, next door and, nearby that are more deserving of your business. Especially, since the ""dining room"" is no longer open 24 hours.  No drive through. Sad. Literally, steps from the pier. The collective grime of all of Santa Monica resides on this location surrounding sidewalks. The homeless aren't the issue.  It is the mentally disturbed , the hustlers  and questionable addicts. This is not a family friendly location.  Wisely most families recognize this and steer clear.  These truths sometimes slip pass the trained smiles of the cashiers and you see the weariness and defeat.  No other business has these issues!  Not one.  Food?  No problems."
11432,11,4 years ago,5 stars,"First thing that caught my eye was its employees, within the times I've stopped by this branch of the Goldin Ark. Reason being is do to it's great customer service. I understand most McDonald's now have self service available to its customers but the times that I've gone to the beach in Santa Monica it's always been alot easier to be attended by their kind employees."

11435,11,5 years ago,1 star,I got a raw meat burger. It was cooked outside of it. But inside under the part was cooked was very raw meat. That was unfit to eat. And made me sick. I don't prefer NO body to go eat their at all they will. Kill you with uncooked meat in your burgers.
11436,11,a year ago,2 stars,No drive thru; there is a parking lot area; very busy and chaotic; service was reasonable.
11437,11,5 years ago,4 stars,"They were friendly but they never gave me a tray because they never asked ""for here or to go"". The service was fast, I had my food ready before I could fill up my drink."
11438,11,4 years ago,3 stars,"First of all,  you will have a Santa Monica price here.  That means it's more expensive than other places for the same item in the menu. Secondly,  the restaurant was full of homeless people which disturbed people's meal quite often with their shouting and cussing. Thirdly,  the restroom is freaking filthy."

I dont know who sprayed it but pepper spray was sprayed. There were little kids in there. Cleared the place out. They are trying way too hard to not help ANYBODY
11451,11,5 years ago,4 stars,The food was fast and good for McDonald's. The inside seating area was kinda small and there were a lot of homeless people hanging out in front of the building. The entrance smelled like urine.

My family got two deluxe s round egg, 1small decaf coffee, 2 med coffees with sugar and cream.

Ok sorry I actually came back the other day and the food was amazing this time. Also, there is another McDonald's in my area that's pretty lame. This place has a better service overall.(sort of long review sorry)"
11453,11,4 years ago,3 stars,Every time I go to this McDonald's everyone is so friendly and make me feel welcome EXCEPT the cashier named EDNA. She gave me the WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER!! She was disrespectful and rude. How does McDonald's let her work here?

Would I get it again?  Yeah, why not?  Makes for a mouth watering meal on the go, quick to be served and ready in minutes with that first warm juicy bite followed by a second, third and maybe fourth?  Who knows, really?  Just Get It and Try One Out Today or When the Munchies hit Mount Everest peaks!"
11458,11,4 years ago,5 stars,First the restroom was clean and it wasn't guarded with a keypad... When I see that I'll go elsewhere. I never use a restroom without purchase and I never ask . Even the chicken sandwich was fresh... Thanks for the service

11462,11,4 years ago,4 stars,"The interior of store has recently been upgraded and has made it a lot more pleasant to be in. Due to its proximity to the Pier, there are still plenty of weirdos and homeless people hanging out in and around the store..."
11463,11,a year ago,5 stars,It's fairly crowded but got my iced macchiato and apple pie. The staff were friendly and attentive for the short interaction.
11464,11,6 years ago,4 stars,"Lines can be long, but service is friendly. Sometimes it takes longer for the food to come out, but the employees compensate by doing extra for the wait. The employees do practice good customer service."
11465,11,5 years ago,4 stars,"It's an interesting location for a McDonald's, and this property must be super expensive. Aside from that, it's a good enough place, and I give it 4 stars based on the expectations that come from a McDonald's to begin with. If you're on the Pier and you want a big Mac or some mcnuggets, this is your spot."
11466,11,a year ago,1 star,"Worst one I've ever been to! They were rude, an employee was arguing with a customer plus it was super dirty! We walked out!"
11467,11,4 years ago,1 star,"I need to use the bathroom facilities before I ordered. Mind you, the line was long. I was refused until I purchased something which was my intention but first thing first. The manager as well as security staff were very rude. I will never step foot into that place again."
11468,11,4 years ago,4 stars,They get you in and out fast. I love this McDonald's adjacent to the beach ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and the Metro Expo Line
11469,11,3 years ago,2 stars,"At first, I felt hungry so I went to this very fancy Mickey D's.  But then while getting back home ( which was a long way from the Santa Monica Pier ) I felt nostalgic and my stomach was hurting really bad.  So I had to stop at Carl's Jr. on  Newhall for the bathroom."
11470,11,5 years ago,5 stars,Blessya all let's all get along. McDonald is giving back .Teenager do have a place to stay it hard on them. Let's live and love. Homeless is trying doing it staying clean Amen. Grace..keep it moving.smile. Sister Ms Rose. PEACE
11471,11,4 years ago,1 star,"Worst customer service ever. Manager is rude and racist. I have been there twice and have witnessed the bad training of employees. Manager in nightshift charge wont help out at all. And I witness how rude she was to some customers, and when I asked to talk to a manager she insulted me and turned me away .  Mcdonalds. You should take complaints into consideration. All those complaints from us the customers.  I'm afraid if I go again instead of a big mac I'll get a mcwhooping."
11472,11,4 years ago,3 stars,My order was not completed because I asked for grape jelly and 2 employees gave me strawberry and said grape didn't exist at that store. When I told the head manager I was allergic to strawberries she apologized to me and said they have plenty of grape jelly and gave me 2. I also had no napkins in the bag so I had to come back.

11474,11,4 years ago,1 star,"This review is for the young lady that worked the night of April 7th, she was repeating the ticket numbers to customers after her cowoker behind the counter yelled out the numbers.

11476,11,4 years ago,4 stars,"The order was done really quickly, and that was greatly appreciated because we were in a hurry. We bought 20 McNuggets and they tasted amazing! Every one!"
11477,11,4 years ago,5 stars,"The terror of the men was palpable in the air. The stench of blood and bodily waste clung heavy. It had been three days and four nights of terror. Ever since the men had come to this island,  it seemed like everything had gone wrong. Not just like God had abandoned them, but had an active hand against them. The coke here is always watered down."
11478,11,6 years ago,1 star,The worst service ever... the people behind us got their orders but our order never been processed. We decided to cancel our order instead. The manager never apologized for that error. I still got the receipt. If ever the corporate head wants to contact me I am willing to give them what took place in that McDonald's. I hope the manager will get fired for it!!!!
11479,11,2 years ago,5 stars,Great customer service for such a busy location. Eating area is kept clean throughout despite obvious challenges of a beach location
11480,11,3 years ago,4 stars,"The food was good.  I mean,  they put several pickles in my yummy burger.  The fries were perfect.  The wait was a little long."
11481,11,3 years ago,1 star,"No refills, ruins the Mcdonalds tradition. Staff is nice , but its too packed and not to much staff to help getting drinks.. Bring back the soda machine."

11484,11,3 years ago,5 stars,"Fast service. But if you want straws, you have to ask for them in Santa Monica. They give you a paper straw, so if you have a resusable straw, i recomend bringing one. Self-service systems are installed to reduce waiting time."
11485,11,3 years ago,2 stars,Too many homeless hang out in front of here. A lot of them are violent. No drink refills here because people would take cups out of the trash and steal soda.

11487,11,6 years ago,4 stars,"I love the CA McDonalds have McChickens (we only have Hot N' Spicy in AZ). The service was fast, and the food was fresh and cheap. It was also accurate (no missing items). This is how fast food should always be."

11489,11,3 years ago,4 stars,"Ruthlessly expensive McDonalds food because it's by the beach, but they take the mobile order deals. Security on site though not too pushy. People seemed friendly enough."
11490,11,4 years ago,3 stars,"Just another McDonalds restaurant for a quick meal. The quality is the same than in any other McDonalds restaurant. So nothing better than in others. From my point of view the services were not as clean as I have expected. That is the only bad ""point"""
11491,11,3 years ago,3 stars,Before heading to Santa Monica pier we made a lunch break here so we can grab a quick bite to eat before heading to the beach. Location was great and the service was fast and accurate.

11493,11,6 years ago,1 star,"Cashier had her hair in a ponytail and so did all the other workers (that's not allowed , servsafe states you can only have you're hair in a braid or bun when working with food) one of the cooks had on of the sides her shirt in a knot exposing her lower right stomach. I asked the manager and he said the cashier had her hair down in a pony tail because she was almost leaving and the chick with the shirt up was because he shirt got in the way of her cleaning. OH! BTW she was cooking and sweeping with out washing hands !."
11494,11,6 months ago,5 stars,Always very quick and helpful
11495,11,4 years ago,3 stars,"Very good service they try to keep it clean, only alot of homeless ppl. We get something quick to go always full of ppl too."

11497,11,2 years ago,5 stars,"Nice place to dine in (outside obviously) and take out is fast. Just wish it had a driver thru, overall fast service."
11498,11,6 years ago,5 stars,Great place for inexpensive food right at Santa Monica Pier. There is also a public parking just below this place. But just inquire about the price first. We were charged $30 for parking and there were cheaper options available nearby.
11499,11,5 years ago,1 star,This place is dirty and employees don't care. Also homeless hangout here all day everyday. It's a good thing police come here often so they keep crime down.
11500,11,6 years ago,1 star,"Attitude. Lack of knowledge of procedures. Terrible customer service. The place is filthy. Who runs this place? Definitely not a place I would recommend if you're having a good day. This place will ruin that, wholesale. Good riddance."
11501,11,8 months ago,1 star,The old lady on the cashier is so RUDE. She speaks poorly english and is rude.
11502,11,6 years ago,4 stars,The cheapest place to eat at when your by the pier literally. If your on a budget Mikey Ds serves you at its finest. The problem is they dont have the dollar menu anymore and this place can get packed during lunch hours.
11503,11,3 years ago,5 stars,"Haven't been here in a while, they have remodeled. They have self order and cashier order. It's close to the peir so expect your occasional homeless ppl but there is a security guard."

No parking NO drive thru security more worried about masks then the drugs dealing at the door."

11506,11,3 years ago,1 star,"Horrible service after the remodeling. Very rude attendant, they refused the refill traditional on all other Mcdonalds restaurants and security was super rude reminding I should leave the parking in 30 minutes (I was in the store for 12 minutes)"
11507,11,4 years ago,4 stars,I go to every McDonalds I can. This one is quick service and good food. But please note that it gets a little crazy at night time. This is a very busy spot next to the pier.
11508,11,4 years ago,4 stars,Always a nice and friendly place to go. Fast and with good prices as always. It will be there when you need a food.
11509,11,4 years ago,2 stars,Rude cashier. Dirty seats and tables. And full of very crazy looking people/drugs (i felt a little bit uncomfortable) The Hot chocolate didn't taste like HC at all.
11510,11,a year ago,5 stars,Always for my husbands coffe we stip buy. Value for money for a senior coffee.
11511,11,4 years ago,3 stars,Long lines and short staffed it seemed.  They can be good other then that.  Tried the bacon cheese fries and I instantly wished they was not only for a limited time only.
11512,11,3 years ago,4 stars,"Was a McDonald's. You know what you get. The store itself was clean, the service was prompt and the people were nice. The automated ordering machines were a pain to use though and we gave up as it was unresponsive"
11513,11,a year ago,1 star,"Asked for refund and the cashier faked the transaction I asked if it completed and she said yes. I did not get the refund.

The sandwich was disrespectful ï¿½ï"
11514,11,a year ago,3 stars,Very slow
11515,11,3 years ago,4 stars,"Kind of  confusing as people were just standing everywhere and one of the workers looked lost herself. Once it cleared out some t hmm ings settled, the food was accurate and warm :)"
11516,11,4 months ago,5 stars,Wonderful customer service
11517,11,6 years ago,3 stars,"Out of the places I have visited here sadly this one offered at least the most friendly of the people I encountered.

However it is more expensive then the basic McDonalds you're use to. It is one of the cheapest around considering your other options."
11518,11,4 years ago,1 star,"Horrible customer service I have ever seen. There is a staff named LOVE, she has the worst behave with customers ever. She even dont know how to talk. She did nit gave me a ranch"

11524,11,6 years ago,3 stars,The McDonald's was busy but very efficient. Can't say I was impressed with the 2 napkins provides for 3 people's food and how they didn't add the ketchup requested.
11525,11,a year ago,5 stars,Everything was everything as usual.  Keep up the good work.  Thanks to  McDonald's for a happy meal ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

11530,11,4 years ago,3 stars,It was interesting I've never had to pay for parking in my life or for the bathroom but it was nice to eat some McDonald's at the high price that it was
11531,11,5 years ago,3 stars,They really try hard to keep it clean and friendly but due to so many homeless people inside and out of the store it's impossible to enjoy coming to this location without be harassed by them.  There's free parking on site.
11532,11,6 years ago,5 stars,Just left the Santa Monica Pier.  Couldn't find an ice cream cone single scoop for less than $6. Thank you McDonald's for having a scoop of Creamy vanilla ice cream for $1.42

11535,11,6 years ago,3 stars,It was crowded and it was a little confusing to find the line but the food came fast and was consistent with other locations.  We ate in a covered outside location that was really nice.
11536,11,5 years ago,1 star,Would have given a 5 but the young black guy asked for my receipt for both orders after I reached for my bag but he never asked anyone else for their receipt and yes I was paying close attention.
11537,11,3 years ago,2 stars,"The service is mediocre to put it light.. And the cleanliness of this establishment.. Well service blows that out of the water. I hate to be so dark about this, but it truly is gross."

11539,11,3 years ago,4 stars,"It's McDonald's, fast and cheap and admitted one of my guilty pleasures. Sometime I just want a cheap hamburger even if I could grill up a gourmet at home."
11540,11,4 years ago,4 stars,It was too busy! There going put the door I suggest going to the one of the many local eateries they are all much better than here
11541,11,a year ago,1 star,Me and my dog went to McDonald's today I could see that they are overcrowded because the food is not that good I was very disappointed and to know that they're overworked breaks my heart cuz they're not feeding the people the way they should and they're not preparing the food properly
11542,11,5 years ago,5 stars,My favorite McDonald's in all the world is this one. I get to eat outside or just hang outside and watch the beach goers and tourist while listening to there good choice in music over the intercom 24/7.

11566,11,3 years ago,5 stars,It's the only fast food place to grab a late night/early morning bite to eat in Santa Monica where you can still dine in. It's also a short walking distance from the Santa Monica Pier.
11567,11,4 years ago,1 star,It practically says its open 24/7 but I just went right now at 4:25 am and its not open. I called and asked what time they open and the lady that answered was really rude. Now I dont have nothing to eat for my lunch. Y'all need to change what hours are you open because its really confusing and annoying going to your store and its not even open.
11568,11,4 years ago,2 stars,"The management and staff argues with the customers and it's like a prison, and highly prejudiced in quality of service towards fellow brown folks.  It's disgusting."

11893,11,4 years ago,1 star,They used to be super cool! Since the remodel they turned into nazis! No water without a receipt. The stupid guard started a fight with a homeless man who came in. I dont know who sprayed it but pepper spray was sprayed. There were little kids in there. Cleared the place out. They are trying way too hard to not help ANYBODY
11894,30,a month ago,5 stars,"Great experience. Food was great, the ice cream machine was working. You can take the elevator or the stairs upstairs for the arcade fun. Also side note I did lost my phone while here and the employee was so great I wish I had her name but she made finding my phone a priority. Me and my family will be returning here again next time weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"

However, our food was not delivered until about 30 minutes after we placed our order.

11896,30,6 months ago,5 stars,"Love the world's largest McDonald's.  Has a kids Play Place, fun arcade upstairs, elevator, can order pizza and many other cool menu items.

Although usually busy, service is on pace. Got my meal in about 15 minutes.  I love this location. Found parking in about 10 minutes."
11897,30,a year ago,2 stars,"My experience visiting this place was not good. It was not because the place that is a nice building with many things to do specially for kids but for the service. This McDonald's offers Pasta and Pizza and I had the terrible idea of order a pizza along with many other things. I have to wait more then an hour and 15 minutes for it.  The place was plenty of tourists many of them in groups like mine and most of them had the same problem. The staff attention was not good. They were overwhelmed and didn't warning about the long waiting time. In some cases one hour and a half. This is considered the largest McDonald's in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city. They should improve their service, especially in the pizza area. As a positive comment, I received a second ration of one of my orders for free in retribution for the long wait. My recomendation is not to order pizza if you are in a hurry, with a large group and during busy times."
11898,30,3 weeks ago,4 stars,"This McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s is one of the nicest and coolest McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve ever been to.

They offer non traditional menu options, such as build your own pasta, ravioli, pizza, cake, cheese cake, etc. it truly is a one of a kind McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
11899,30,7 months ago,3 stars,"The aesthetic of this location was really cool. There is a huge arcade inside as well as play area for kids. Two floors, tons of seating, an aquarium and a bunch of other cool stuff. I was expecting a little better service and food quality with it being the largest McDonald's in the country. It was cool to be able to order pizza and pasta since that is not something typically available at McDonald's but as expected, it wasn't incredibly flavorful. Prices were a bit higher than normal McDonald's as well but with all the extras at the restaurant that makes sense."
11900,30,5 months ago,5 stars,"The World largest McDonald's is a must to visit if you have kids. Besides the typical menu items, you can order pasta and pizza, customized to order. The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty tasty. Only downside is the wait for the food ... about 30 minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received it. Of course, the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade (a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from). The place was packed when we visited. Overall a good experience!"
11901,30,a year ago,5 stars,"Hands down best McDonald's ever!! We loved the game room.
The prices were so reasonable, $25 was more than enough chips to play for as long as we wanted.
They restaurant was clean, the food was fresh and staff was friendly. It also had an elevator that goes to and from the game room and restaurant."
11902,30,9 months ago,4 stars,"World largest McDonald's. Food is the same, they have pizza and pasta too. The seating and ordering process was quick and easy, but actually getting the food on time together was a challenge.

Our burgers came in fairly fast 10 minutes or so, but pizza took 30 minutes+ from the time when we ordered it. I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the pizza.

Honestly, this worth a single visit, especially the playground if you have kids. If you looking for a quick bite, I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker service."
11903,30,10 months ago,3 stars,"It is called the largest McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s in the world! Exterior looks great and interior as well. Two storied building with play area for the kids. Mainly because of the world famous universal studio and Disney park and the other tourist facilities this McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s is always busy.

They have arcade games and a playground all in the second floor. Kids love it here we easy spend about 2 hours, playing and eating and playing again. All food orders are made using the kiosks on the first floor and you take a number and find yourself a table. Your order will be brought to yo"

Pizza at McDonalds?! Yup, we tried it. Overall it was delicious and had great flavor, although the crust was a little thin for my liking.

Overall fairly clean, floors were a little sticky. Bathrooms were clean."
11906,30,a month ago,5 stars,We couldn't wait to visit!!! The atmosphere is a little hectic but the food is amazing! Definitely not food you would eat at your hometown McDonalds. Highly recommend the pesto pasta and chocolate peanut butter cake. Don't forget to visit the arcade and play center upstairs. Watch your child's face light up when you pull into the parking lot!! Highly recommend

11908,30,9 months ago,4 stars,"This location is nice and they deliver the food to your table. Only 4 stars though because the food was cold when it arrived. Probably would have given it 3 stars, but I got 2 extra nuggets in my happy meal."
11909,30,9 months ago,5 stars,"If you love McDonald's this is the place to go. They say it's the world's largest McDonald's. The menu is definitely a bit different with pizza, pasta and waffles as options. There was even an arcade upstairs and a elevator to get up. The sign says the restaurant is open 24-7 which is nice when leaving the amusement parks."

11911,30,a year ago,5 stars,"Great experience. We came here on a recent trip to Orlando. They have a large selection of foods. They also serve pizza and pasta. There is a large bakery selection. On the second floor you can dine at one of the many tables or play in the large arcade. There is a large kids play area, but that is currently closed due to COVID."

The ordering lines were long and playground was 70% full.  Seeing a few people with luggage and felt this could be there first or last meal in Orlando.  This is the biggest McDonald's in the world and the menus are different too, with pizza and pasta.  We tried the pizza and it was actually pretty good."

Yes please! The place was a madhouse, but worth it for the experience. It was our first night visiting Orlando so we didn't let our kiddo run around the H U G E play area... I know, kinda mean. But the amount of children in it and not knowing how often it was cleaned had me a little nervous. Definitely worth the visit, even for just a cheeseburger! And KUDOS to all employees, this place is NUTS! AND a drive-thru?! Bless y'all."
11918,30,8 months ago,4 stars,"This was a great experience. I was staying at Orlando for a week and this was one of the places I wanted to go to. The pizza was really good, Mac tonight was also there which was mind blowing. My only complain was the pizza was pretty greasy, but other then that, I would recommend this for people staying at Orlando"
11919,30,3 months ago,5 stars,Fantastic restaurant. You must visit when in Orlando. The service was good. The wait time for the premium menu items was reasonable. It was very clean and the staff was exceptional.
11920,30,2 weeks ago,4 stars,"The food was quality but service took a while.

I liked the food a lot. I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got both. I also got a large fries a burger and drinks. Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza places.

Only con:
I'd recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast. Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone it's like this."

11923,30,5 months ago,5 stars,This by far is one of the coolest McDonald's you will ever go to! It apparently is one of the largest in the world and is 3 to 4 stories tall! It has a special menu that is only designed for this McDonald's specifically which makes it extremely unique.. they have made to order pastas and pizzas.. now I went today at 1:15 in the afternoon in order to pizza and I got it within 15 minutes.. but before warned if you go during a busy time it could take up to 45 minutes.. and unfortunately that is the downfall dislocation is on Sand Lake Road which is in a tourism driven area off of International Drive and it is one of the busiest locations you will ever go to.. if you go during one of these peak times it is unbelievable how busy and how disorganized the location can actually be... but when they are firing on all cylinders it can be a fantastic experience... when you get the pieces or the pastas it is absolutely high and restaurant quality... it's literally amazing to go into a McDonald's for god sakes.. and get restaurant quality food of this caliber.. my pizza is Ace stone Brick Oven fired pizza and it is fantastic! And it was only a little over $11 with tax that is wonderful.. if you're ever in the area you should definitely try it ï¿½ï

11925,30,7 months ago,4 stars,"I went two times during my visit at Orlando, the first one I took a pizza, it was s great experience have pizza at a McDonalds franchise, the cons is that took about 50min to my pizza get done. Second time a ordered a Deluxe Crispy Chicken and it was great, fast service, nothing to complain."
11926,30,6 months ago,1 star,Overall great place to just look... just look... The pizza was not the disappointment but the decision in ordering the pizza. If anyone wants to eat nasty pizza I recommend buying frozen pizza. It takes 30 mins to get the pizza upon ordering it. It has no cheese and the toppings were underwhelming. The frozen pizza in your local grocery might be a better option.
11927,30,3 years ago,5 stars,"We are in Orlando Florida celebrating my son's 13th birthday so why not check out the world's largest McDonald's.
The place is huge with people from all places checking it out too.
It's 2nd floor is full of arcade games and a children's play area.
They have a pasta and pizza section with a brick oven.
They have multiple touch screen ordering kiosks with people always in queue.
I ordered online with the McDonald's app and picked it up in store or else I would have waited in line.
The whole store is bright and clean including the restrooms.
One thing you like about McDonald's it's the same flavor anywhere in the world you go."
11928,30,6 months ago,3 stars,"This place can be such a Hotspot since it's so special with having pasta pizza waffles and is so unique, but compared to other McDonald's the taste of even a cheeseburger wasn't great. The only highlight was the service the place was clean and the staff very attentive. But good service alone is not enough of the burgers are bad."
11929,30,a year ago,5 stars,This is the busiest McDonald's Ive ever been to. They have the process of customer care down to a science. If you order to go use a kiosk because eating in could take a while because a server has to walk the food over. They have a pastry cafe and the play area is massive. The employees are nice and gave great service. Just a heads up. I would avoid the drive thru between the hours of 7am-Midnight. Those are the times when people are either going or coming from theme park.
11930,30,a year ago,4 stars,Kids love mickey d's so we had to stop by. You order from a kiosk and wait for your number to be called. Thought it was weird they didn't have the hot n spicy but it was pretty cool just to be there. They do have pizza and pasta but we opted to stick to the originals we know. Game room is small but again it's all about the experience.  Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed:)
11931,30,a year ago,5 stars,"This ""Big McDonalds"" is a very nice establishment. The staff seemed to be efficient and friendly. Even better than the food was the arcade $5 for 30 mins of unlimited play. (A few games are broken but that was okay) If you choose to buy credits instead you can buy things with the tickets you earn. (Like chuck'e'cheese)

Note: The playplace is currently closed due to covid, it will soon open according to my sources though."

The food is actually brought out to you which is nice and there are some novel items on the menu, but it's still just McDonalds (with higher prices). Is definitely worth stopping at if you have child that likes the Play Places!"
11934,30,a year ago,5 stars,"This McDonald's is definitely a must be location if you're a fan of the Big Mac, the pizza is surprisingly good the staff is super kind they constantly ask you if you need help her if everything is good.

There's plenty of tables to accommodate everybody, wait time and fast.

And if you're Coca-Cola connoisseur the soda fountain is perfect.

Super clean upstairs as a full arcade really cool if you have kids definitely stop by here you have a chance."
11935,30,a month ago,5 stars,"This being billed as the largest McDonalds in the world, I had to stop and see it. It is certainly BIG. They have a dessert station, brick oven for pizza and huge play area for the kids. When I stopped it was busy and the employees were friendly and helpful. The restaurant and dining area appeared clean, which is difficult to do in a high volume fast food restaurant. I just grabbed a burger and shake and it was typical McDonalds."

11938,30,4 months ago,5 stars,"BIGGEST MCDONALD'S IN THE WORLD!!!

We drove by this McDonald's and talked about how it was probably one of the biggest McDonald's in the world. After googling it it was! So we had to stop in!

It was definitely a cool experience. They offer More options than just the traditional McDonald's. We did build our own pasta and the pasta was excellent!

They also offer pizzas and different pastry options. Like cheesecake, cake, ice cream specialties.

This is a two-level McDonald's but looks to be four stories.

The first floor is the dining and kitchen. Second floor is a large play place that's two storage tall and they also have a arcade where you can earn points towards toy prizes. Kind of like Chuck e cheese..

We spent a few hours here It's spent around $30 for four of us. So it wasn't that bad.

Definitely cool to say you into the biggest McDonald's in the world!"
11939,30,5 months ago,3 stars,"This is a very unique location. They offer pasta and pizza, something you would not find at any other McDonald's. They have a huge Play area for kids and a nice number of play machine la that requiere a play card. Imagine some sort of chuck e cheese but in a 2 stories building. Unfortunately, it is just like many other McDonald's, food is ok service is bad and place is a mess."
11940,30,a year ago,5 stars,"Pretty awesome place. On top of your standard items, they sell pasta, pizza and pastries. Surprisingly, the pizza and pasta was quite good, for McDonalds. The place also offers a very reasonable arcade, $5 unlimited play for 30 minutes. The only draw back to the timed purchase is that you don't earn tickets. They do have a trade in booth with prizes for your tickets.
Overall, we came here for the experience of going to the world's largest McDonalds and came out pretty satisfied with the while experience. Enjoy y'all!"
11941,30,2 weeks ago,4 stars,"Massive size, diverse menu, and captivating ambiance. Arcade games, play area, and free Wi-Fi add to the fun. Minor wait times during peaks.

There was hardly enough parking for cars, let alone bigger vehicles.
We have a 26 ft Class C RV. There is no oversized parking. We got lucky with parking, but others did not.

But seriously, If your family likes McDonald's, this McDonald's is worth it!
We ordered pizza and chocolate cake.. at McDonald's!

But the most memorable part was the second floor. Not only is there an incredible, gigantic three-story all enclosed play place (with a single entry/exit point!) There is also an extremely large arcade with all sorts of v""around a corner"" and can't be seen from the dining area.  For kids that ""must"" play a game, there are 2 dining tables with touchscreens!

There's plenty of seating (both upstairs and on the main floor) and clean bathrooms on both levels.

The kids will remember this McDonald's!"
11943,30,a week ago,5 stars,"Well, this was an experience. It was definitely fun for the kids. Arcade, and a huge play area, when I went to the play area was closed but it was big. This McDonald's has 2 floors, and the typical McDonald's food the twist there is they also sell pasta dishes and pizza. Wow! I know, right?"
11944,30,a year ago,4 stars,"Arcade and play place on second floor was awesome. This McDonald's offers pizza, pasta, and philly cheese steaks, just to name a few. Ordered from the regular menu however and fries were meh. Warm but soggy. There was a employee walking by asking if everything was ok which lead me to realize I didn't get juice for my happy meals which they retrieved."

11946,30,a year ago,5 stars,We come here every time we are in Orlando and this was the first time we tried the pasta.  It was a little disappointing that you couldn't add chicken or sausage to it but was delicious nonetheless. The pizza and chocolate cake we also very good.  The store was well maintained and clean.  The staff was friendly despite the business.
11947,30,10 months ago,4 stars,"Playplace was large and 6 year old had fun. Nowhere for disabled 13 year old to sit while brother played. Nowhere to put drinks while playing without occupying eating tables. Not enough tables for guests. Long lines at kiosk. Kiosk menu needs easier ways to find special items. Many people asking for help. Over a half hour looking for parking, had to park at another business and walk over. Needs more space. Staff was all helpful, manager was friendly, Italian section interesting to watch, restaurant was clean. Nice experience, only needs more space."

11949,30,11 months ago,4 stars,Clean. Was surprised to see pasta and pizza as our local McD's does not have these items. The arcade is upstairs you can take an elevator or the stairs. It is really nice.
11950,30,8 months ago,2 stars,"Went on a Thursday so it wasn't overwhelmingly busy but still busy enough that there were lines to the kiosks & people wandering to find a cash register employee. Wait time was not bad. Food came in probably 15 mins. We stayed downstairs to receive our trays at the counter, I could see how there would be an issue if you went upstairs to sit & waited for an employee to come find you. The girl who brought our food was very very nice! We received our pastas first even though we ordered the pizza first so I have a feeling it was just sauce pots sitting on warmers to dump quick dishes. Not sure why other comments say their pasta took long. Our pizza came out fine. Really not worth the money but we went for the experience, you get what you get in Orlando... standard happy meal was $8 and pasta meals were $15 for a smallish portion of pasta with a McChicken thrown on top."
11951,30,a year ago,5 stars,"This McDonald's has everything. Even pizza and pasta.
Bear in mind that it's a little expensive if you order items individually. So get the combos if you can that way you save money.

The place was totally renovated a few years back.

Nice place on International Drive."
11952,30,a year ago,1 star,"If I could give it no stars i would. Me and my family have been coming to Florida for 3yrs straight now and we always wanted to stop here, but it was always packed and we could never get in. So tonight we were fortunate to get in with no traffic and when I say I wish we would've kept going. 1st I would start off with its over crowed inside, very unorganized  and no manager direction. Ordered our food at 9:05pm got our order at 9:30 my niece ordered a Belgian waffle at 9:30 on the dot at 10:00pm it still wasn't ready so I asked very politely bc I'm a very nice person if they had made our order # for the waffle the guy said it wasn't ready, but we stood there watching them make waffles and throw them on the shelf so I asked was 1 of the waffles my order he went to check each ticket and sadly not 1 of them was my the order #. I also witnessed him ask 1 of the workers about it. She was an older woman when I say she was very rude didn't care and walked off as he was asking her so at that point I just wanted a refund. Oh no, but it doesn't stop there got in the car my whole order was cold and the lack of work they put into making food is ridiculous. I do not recommend this place and we will never come here again. My burger was missing a whole top layer of meat, lettuce, cheese and sauce. This is beyond ridiculous I was so exhausted with this place I just took it as a lose and went back to our place of stay. This is the worst McDonald's ever!!!!"
11953,30,3 months ago,5 stars,"Well, obviously es a different place in comparatively other McDonald's, but be ready to a lot of people, childrens yelling and running, anyways still such a amazing place.they cook a good pizza that was oh! ..... Worth it."
11954,30,7 months ago,5 stars,For this to be the largest McDonald's I wasn't sure what to expect. My daughter wanted to stop by while we were visiting. It was very busy as to be expected. Staff was friendly. Really cool spot. They even have pizza and pasta on the menu. How awesome lol
11955,30,a month ago,4 stars,"Since I'm known as ""Jimmy McRib"" I had to take the opportunity of visiting the world's largest McDonalds, even though it meant and extra hour and fifteen minute drive each way....  Anyways, this place is huge, and legendary among fast food junkies like myself for the fact that they serve pizza and pasta.  I would have been more impressed if they had the McRib too, but it was not to be, even at the world's largest McDonalds.

This was an incredibly busy place, even at 9:30pm.  There are tons of local hotels and tourists were everywhere, with most of them speaking a language besides English.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest, but that had to be due to the fact that they are open 24/7 and always busy.  To my surprise, the bathrooms were very clean and nice.

Anyways, what is unique at this McDonalds:
- Hand dipped hard ice cream
- Multiple stories, with an arcade and playland upstairs
- A pizza and pasta section
- A big fish tank in the lobby

It was difficult to get into the parking lot due to construction and traffic, but there was plenty of parking.  The one side of the building has a giant neon Ronald McDonald which was cool.  I wanted to try the pizza or pasta, but unfortunately I had eaten a nice dinner about an hour earlier and only had room for a hamburger, which I ordered through the app.  It was pretty hectic inside, with tons of kiosks for ordering, which was helpful since they had different language selections to match the language of those ordering.  Some of my family got hand scooped ice cream, but it was a nightmare, as nobody was working that section, and we had to wait ten minutes after waiting in the busy line at the counter to ask for somebody to help us.  But, they eventually got their hard ice cream and it was good.

It was definitely neat to see this McDonalds, but it was a bit too busy for me, and the workers said that this was light traffic as compared to how busy it gets during the day."

Punch in your order on the screen, pay, then find a seat and staff will find you to deliver your meal. Philly Cheese steak was our #1 pick, the stone oven thin crust pizza was great, and the pasta, considering it was from a fast food place was very good. Kids loved the arcade and play place too."

11966,30,2 months ago,3 stars,"I realize this is a REALLY BIG and REALLY POPULAR location, because it is unique... My friend and I were only in town for a few days, and this is something we wanted to experience.

While there we figured that we would order something, so we both got a dessert item, my friend got a McFlurry, and I got a Hard Ice Cream in a Waffle Cone.

We ordered from the self serve kiosk, for some reason the one we were at was not accepting payment, not sure if the others were broken too? So I went to the one counter that had an Employee and paid there, since it was Ice Cream I was told that it would be available at the Ice Cream counter, which made sense, since that's where the Hard Ice Cream was.

My friend and I waited quite awhile for a Staff Member to notice us standing there, I say notice us, since some came close, but never looked over at us... When one finally did I flagged her down, she told us that she ""has not be told to come here"" then walked away!?!

So, I went to the main counter, as I approached my number was being called from the main counter, so I guess the Ice Cream counter was not the pick up location? Ahh, the McFlurry came from the main counter, but the Hard Ice Cream was coming from the Ice Cream counter... sure, that makes sense I suppose?

I head back over to the Ice Cream Counter, and guess who reluctantly appears? The young Female Employee who was now told to come over to serve me... she DID NOT look impressed to be there! After fighting with the sliding glass doors that cover the Hard Ice Cream for several minutes, she finally got them open, I had to point out the Rocky Road Ice Cream, one small scoop was placed on the Waffle Cone, and I was sent on my way... I'm not sure what it was supposed to look like, since on the Kiosk, it only shows an empty Waffle Cone with no option of its contents.

It was an interesting place, but based on this one visit, I would likely not return unless it was much less busy."

We got a pepperoni pizza and some alfredo pasta. You can see them cook these, which was pretty cool. They have an arcade upstairs and the place has tons of places to eat."
11979,30,2 months ago,4 stars,"You're paying for what you're receiving. This is a crowded McDonald's. Keep that in mind, lines are long, and the food is the same as any other McDonald's except for the specials here, pasta, pizza, and desserts. People are trying their best, so don't expect a 5-star restaurant treatment. If you have time and a limited budget, this will fulfill your curiosity.
P.s. Always check for deals, they always have discounts."
11980,30,a month ago,5 stars,"Who knew Orlando, FL has the biggest McDonald's in the world? I didn't until this week. I was pleasantly surprised! This was not a normal fast food dine-in meal. The atmosphere was pretty cool. The menu, I expected. I mean who can get a brick-oven pizza at McDonald's? Pasta, philly cheese steak sandwiches frozen ice cream, and customizable orders from the menu. Oh, I almost forgot about the arcade on the top floor. But what else should you expect since the restaurant is not far from Disney World!"
11981,30,a month ago,4 stars,"I think it's the largest in the world! 3 stories, MASSIVE kids playground, the serve pasta dishes on actual plates, a real pizza oven, scoop able ice cream parlor, elevators as well.
I think it's a test kitchen type of thing. Throngs of people. Also automatic trash compactors."

Apparently they lost our order and like 10 others. It was chaos. Everyone was going up and asking for their money back. The only reason Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m giving 5 stars is because the manager, Mashawna, was super kind "
11984,30,3 days ago,5 stars,"This place was wicked crazy. I went with family, and we all did our own orders, and they missed at least 2 items for every single one of our orders. It was bizarre. I've never seen a McDonalds that serves pizza and pasta and has an arcade. The upstairs where the kids' playground and the arcade were was SO HOT. It was probably borderline unsafe for how hot it was for being inside the building. Especially since the kid's playplace was up there. I would be afraid of kids getting getting dehydrated and potentially even getting heatstroke."
11985,30,7 months ago,5 stars,My family really enjoyed this place!! They bring your food to your table. I love the different food options they have.

11990,30,4 weeks ago,5 stars,Really fun place and they have freshly made pasta and pizza!! There are cool desserts there to try as well.
11991,30,7 months ago,3 stars,"I found a brochure on the world's largest mcds and we had to go! The place itself was super cool! We watched people cooking and had fun in the large play area, and the piano guy kept us singing tunes!

But our fries weren't cooked and they weren't even filled up.  We tried getting service and there was rudeness to help us.  I was seriously underwhelmed at food and service.   It wasn't even busy when we went."
11992,30,2 months ago,5 stars,"The pizza is really good.  We got 3 and everyone liked it.  About the size of a medium pizza hut pizza, but oven fired (yes,  there are stone fired pizza ovens in here!) and thin crust. The Philly cheesesteak was really good and the chocolate explosion cake was tasty. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
If you order to eat there and order pasta or the cheesesteak, it comes on REAL plates/ pasta bowls.  Thought that was neat.

Not surprisingly,  our fries were cold and the Big Mac was missing a burger... pretty consistent with all other McDonald's on that point. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

11994,30,2 months ago,3 stars,"Place looks amazing... from the outside. Unfortunately inside was very disappointing. It was a Saturday night so it was busy but it felt chaotic & unclean,  poor staff looked really tired and unhappy. Lots of menu items unavailable, the buns were dried out and drinks had little fizz.... Just like the staff!
A real disappointment as our kids were really looking to our visit. They even left the play area staying that it felt dirty."
11995,30,a week ago,5 stars,"Great experience. Food was great, the ice cream machine was working. You can take the elevator or the stairs upstairs for the arcade fun. Also side note I did lost my phone while here and the employee was so great I wish I had her name but she made finding my phone a priority. Me and my family will be returning here again next time weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"

11997,30,10 months ago,5 stars,"The best thing about the world's largest McDonald's could be the pizza, the cheesecake, the arcade, the jumbo playground.. all that is great but the BEST part of this McDonald's is the MacTonight animatronic mounted on the wall.

11998,30,3 months ago,5 stars,This place was so good we went back a second time they have pizza and pasta AND CAKE at McDonald's I rate this place one of the best McDonald's experiences ever don't forget they have a giant play area upstairs that is free as a giant Jungle Gym area and then your best bet is to pay the $5 for 30 minutes of arcade time and you got 30 minutes to play all the games you want
11999,30,5 months ago,3 stars,"Food took forever to come out. I had ordered a pizza which only took about 15 minutes to come out. Everybody's else's food took about another 30 minutes-overall 45 minutes- to come out. I had long finished my pizza by the time everything else came out. Alot of others had the same issue and there was a line of people asking where their food was. When we finally got it, they didn't even give us everything we ordered. These were the sauces we had ordered and one drinks cup- which you have to fill yourself."

Lol didn't try those, but the cake slices they have looked awesome plus handscooped icecream come on, no brainer, just go before u leave Florida"
12003,30,a week ago,3 stars,"Very busy McDonald's. They have, on the second floor, some games for the kids and families, and they also bring the food to your table. They have the regular McDonald's menu, but they also offer others kinds of things like pizza and pasta. I had the opportunity to try the pasta, and it was good. They have different options of pasta, sauces, veggies, and meats that you can add.
Now, this is what happened to me. When you make your order at the screen, and you order pizza or pasta, it is done at a different food station from where they do the regular food. After a few minutes, I got the pasta at my table, but the rest of the order was missing. Sadly, they lost the rest of my order (happy meal and a coffee). After 20 minutes, I talked to the manager about my order, and she didn't  hesitate to help me. She was very nice and she personally took care of my order.
If you ask me if I recommend this McDonald's, it depends. If you're looking for a McDonald's that offers more than burgers, yes. If you want your kids to have a little bit of fun without a time restriction, yes, it is a good option.  But if you are in a rush, no, I don't recommend this McDonald's."

Although a little more pricey this trip to this mcdonalds was worth it.. they have a large arcade located on the second floor,, they have an ice cream and dessert station which serves chocolate cake and a few other types of cakes.This mcdonalds offered Belgian waffles(a little over $9), ham and cheese French toast for breakfast."

12008,30,a month ago,5 stars,"I was shocked to go into a Mcdonald and order grilled chicken alfredo. This McDonald in Orlando, Florida, has a kid area and arcade. They also have pizza that can be purchased. It has two floors accessible with an elevator. Crazy but fantastic at the same time."
12009,30,a year ago,4 stars,"This McDonald's is really nice. Super big and offers other foods other then McDonalds lol. It also has a second floor with more seating and a arcade section for fun. They offer a tap menu option and table service. So once your done ordering thru the self tap options you grab a number and have a seat.

We ordered our regular McDonald's food with the addition of a strawberry and banana waffle. Which was bomb.

I did feel like the store was a bit dirty. But it was probably cause it had a rush. After we left it calmed down and the employees were cleaning.

It is on the more expensive side. We ordered two Mcdoubles (which we had a coupon and applied it) large fries, a small drink and the waffle. The total was 19 bucks... It would have been 23... Lol"
12010,30,a week ago,1 star,"Growing up in Orlando, I visited this location as a child and knew the Oerther family. Decided to take my child here for her first visit and sadly, was left pretty infuriated.

First, I timed it and it took 25 minutes for us to receive our order. We had to stop and ask an employee what the hold up was. When they finally brought our order out to us, my daughter was missing her drink which you can clearly see on the receipt, is there (Tea & Lemonade). I asked another employee about it, he took my receipt and never came back. So I had to leave my hot food and go stand at the front for a good 5-8 minutes, just to ask a third person for the drink. How hard is it just to give me a cup that I clearly didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t receive and I will just make it myself at a machine?

They gave me a card to come back for a free meal and apologized but it was beyond frustrating for a $25 McDonalds meal.

The peanut butter cake was delicious and it looks like the ack in service."
12011,30,2 months ago,5 stars,This location is said to be the largest McDonald's in the world! We stopped in after a day at Universal. We arrived after 11 and it was crazy busy. Our order took at least 30min before it was ready...but under the very busy circumstances it was understandable. They have unique dishes such as pasta and wood fired pizza which seemed very popular. Multi level seating....games room and various entertainment segments through the store as well to make the experience even better. Lots of free parking and dual drive thru. Overall this McDonalds is a flagship location for sure!
12012,30,4 months ago,5 stars,This was my first time visiting this location. The staff was very nice and service was great. The atmosphere was very good. We just didn't get to visit the second floor because the elevator was closed.

Annnyyyyyways. Probably won't return."
12015,30,a week ago,3 stars,"Our family went to experience this McDonald's one of a kind menu; the pizza had a great crust, but I will put light sauce next time.

Really cool to sit down and watch them make you pizza."

12019,30,5 days ago,2 stars,"Checked this off my list.

What
I thought id have to check out the biggest play area at a McDonalds.. I actually have lived in Orlando for over 15 years and today was the first time I went. Upon reading some review, I just realized it is the largest... and an actual tourist attraction... I took a toddler her to play and BOY what an experience.

Environment
This is right off a busy intersection, i-Drive and sand lake. The parking can get packed.. The building is huge! You cannot miss it. It is 2 stories and the play area is quite big as well, with an arcade inside. There are 2 stories, you enter the play area on level 2. You order the food downstairs and you can sit upstairs. There are a lot of self ordering machines so it makes ordering go a little faster? Upstairs was VERY HOT! Like there was no AC... and when you walk downstairs it was cool.

Niceness of the staff
Barely had any interactions with the staff. It was ok.

Dollar
They also sell pizza, and that was ok... it starts at $9 and every topping is at least $1

Yes?
Probably not... not really recommended."

12037,30,5 months ago,4 stars,"This McDonald's has a pizza and pasta area made to order and is very good but like any McDonald's it's hard to find the staff that are willing to work in such a busy and crazy place. You cannot order with a real person inside. You have to order from a kiosk and they don't always get your order right or forget something. There is a drive through that is kind of like a race track and wraps around the building with 2 or 3 lanes and if your order is wrong, oh well, so be it. Just take it or leave it. There is a huge play place for kids and a second floor with an elevator."

When I went the game room up stairs with the huge play ground the air wasn't working, half of the games were broken, they are so short staffed there is no employee to redeem your tickets. The play area wasn't well cleaned at all and the bathrooms weren't kept up. I'm sure do to the fact they are so very busy and short staffed. The pizza was good and the peanut butter cake was good. But not worth the hype especially with all the craziness that was going among many other issues."

Went there at 10pm and hung out and kids played until about 11:20pm - but you would think that it was lunch time with how busy they were. We were surprised at how fast the food came to our table and the staff were friendly.  Well done McDonald's!"

My family however had a pretty good time, so I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t bother to explain to them the downsides of mas"
12048,30,a week ago,3 stars,"It was a pretty good experience. Their accuracy definitely needs attention. When we got our food, I asked if she was sure this was my entire order. It was not. We were missing all the fries.  Yes, I know I should have checked for myself, but I like to trust people to take pride in their work. Before you say that they were busy, no, they were not. But on a really good note, the lady taking my order at the drive-thru was fantastic at customer service. I wish I knew her name cause I would definitely give her a shout-out."
12049,30,4 months ago,3 stars,"There are foods that are offered that are not offered at typical McDonald's locations, but do not be fooled. The food is similarly mediocre to all the other locations. Young children will beg to use the arcade, which is certainly not any less than a cash grab. Sure, it's fun, but it doesn't offer anything more than a normal McDonald's besides a small, money-demanding arcade, small pizzas, a few different breakfast items, and some cool desserts. Otherwise, it's a cool place to eat if you are wise with your money."

12051,30,3 months ago,3 stars,"The fries weren't salted or flavoured, very bland. I also had a chicken bacon burger which was heavily fried and didn't taste that good. I ordered in store myself and it was quite busy, people were lining up or waiting everywhere. It was also unclear who worked there and who didn't as some people had no uniform but were wandering around behind the counter. They also serve pizza and pasta where you can choose your toppings and sauces. The ice machine was under pressure and couldn't spit ice out fast enough, the second one didn't work at all and the sweet tea was pouring too slowly so I went with something else instead."
12052,30,5 months ago,5 stars,Had to stop here on our way home from Florida. My kids were super excited see this location. They had fun playing in the playground and arcade and we even enjoyed breakfast before getting back on the road.

We ordered waffles and French toast and ham and cheese sandwich. You grab a because this place is super busy and sit down. You can sit and watch the food being made. We saw the food come out and sit and no one grab it employees and managers walk by. Irene went up to a manager and asked how much longer and they said a few more minutes and no one still grabbed it. Finally after 35 minutes one of the same managers who had walked by it several times picked up the meals and tried to serve them to us. We told them that we had watched everything

12057,30,2 days ago,4 stars,"Very big place, i had to order from a kiosk but I'm used to it and fine with it,

I ordered three things came out to about 7$, very decent i ate inside and in about 5 minutes a worker came to my table with my order.

The customer service was very nice and up-stairs they have a play place for the kids, they also serve pizza, pastas and cake here so it surprised me but overall great experience I will say because of the play place there is naturally a lot of parents bringing their kids so it can be very loud."
12058,30,3 weeks ago,1 star,"We waited 50min for 3 burgers and 4 chicken nuggets !!!  Everything was cold.  I asked for hot food, so they put everything in the trash and I waited another 7min to get my order.  1h00 to have my order in this ""Fast Food"".  No one apologized.  I do not recommend going there if you are in a hurry.  All the tables around us waited at least 40min."
12059,30,2 months ago,4 stars,"Largest Mcdonald at the word they said, very good, beside regular manu they have pasta, pizza and steak sandwich's on subs, also big arcade on the secound floor, went for dinner, place was really busy, thats the reason i didnt take pictures from the inside."
12060,30,2 years ago,2 stars,"I think I had much higher expectations of this McDonald's because I was strongly suggested to visit.  I expected a 30 foot statue of Ronald McDonald and it ended up being a lackluster 30 foot lighted outline of Ronald on the building.  The picture online of the building made it look like it was made of a French Fry building structure.  It wasn't.  They had a separate drink station where you gave them your drink order (an extra step because no self service ones anywhere).  They had a separate dessert station, and a walk up food counter to order or self-serve kiosks to order from, where they will serve if you eat in (but not the soft drinks).  It is 2 stories.  The 2nd floor is a play area which I expected would be huge (it isn't), and a small arcade area...very small.  The menu showed some items different from other McDonald's but 95% of them showed OUT OF STOCK. So we just ate the kind of food you could eat at a regular McDonald's only it cost MUCH more! All-in-all,very unexciting and not what it should be for being the WORLD'S LARGEST MCDONALD'S! ï¿½ï"
12061,30,3 months ago,5 stars,"The food was alright, it's one of the biggest McDonald's but quality can be improved with the fish sandwiches being burnt on the edges and burgers were not properly organized within the bun in the big mac, just a bit of feedback compared to regular McDonald's restaurants. Other than that my family had a great time enjoying the upstairs atmosphere and playground."
12062,30,a month ago,3 stars,We waited 45 minutes for an ice cream cone and a piece of cheesecake.  I understand it's a popular place but people that ordered well after us and in larger quantities were getting their stuff before us. Honestly felt like we were forgotten. And the customer service here is surely lacking for it to be such a tourist centered stop
12063,30,5 months ago,2 stars,"A different McDonald's experience worth trying. We had a good time trying different menu items not found at any other McDonald's. Definitely worth a visit if you're coming to Orlando.

Update: Not the same as it used to be. The selections are limited and not as international as it once was. It lost it's uniqueness and it feels like it's just a regular busy McDonald's now. Not recommended anymore."

12066,30,2 days ago,2 stars,"Don't waste your time or money. We were excited to visit here with out of town guests straight from the airport.
1. Kiosks are backed up with a bunch of people each so no where to stand, wait, or snake through with trays of food. Kiosks were glitchy and blanked out every minute.
2. It is at least 10 degrees warmer upstairs so NOT comfortable at all.
3. Even with our order number on the table no one ever brought food...after 20 minutes, i went down stairs and it was sitting there. Then there is no drink station upstairs so with an already full tray, i had to bring food up and then come down for drinks. So why did i have to pick a flavor if the only deliver an empty?
4. No one to help with service or questions. Lady upstairs spoke no English. I had to raise my hand at the counter after standing there 5 minutes to find my food just to get acknowledged.
5. After all that, found one sandwich missing. Went back again and notified i was missing the cheese steak and staff member walked to the other pasta section where it was sitting by itself.
6. Cheeseburgers were not made to order as requested on the kiosk.
7. Big mac was dry. Worst one ever.

We won't be back."

Giant arcade and large play area.
There is even attempt to make like omelette and stuff.  I even saw brick stoves like you would see pizza cooked in. Did I mention a fish tank?

It did take a while to get our food and it was typical McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"
12068,30,2 days ago,2 stars,"Today we had the opportunity to go to such a well-known McDonald's, the truth is that the place is very nice, but in terms of the attention and organization it was terrible, half of my order was missing and although I went to tell them that it was wrong, they did not pay attention to me. So many employees so they can't help me in my order. My children were very excited to go to the play place but their air conditioning did not work and it was unbearably hot. They should pay a little attention to those flaws. Thank you"
12069,30,3 weeks ago,5 stars,Best experience ever. The food was shockingly good. I did pizza and build your own pasta. Customer service was phenomenal.  Restaurant was very clean and we didn't wait long on our food. Can't wait to visit again.
12070,30,3 months ago,5 stars,Obviously one of the most amazing McDonald's I've ever seen. Three stories and a two-story playland. They had premium scoop ice cream and pasta with Alfredo on the menu. Are you kidding me? Pizza and Alfredo at McDonald's? You betcha. Biggest Playland I've seen in the McDonald's for years? Has it. The classic Mac tonight guy playing a piano in the corner? Has it. Easily the best McDonald's I've been to since I was a kid 30 years ago in Las Vegas.
12071,30,2 months ago,4 stars,"A fun place to go to maybe once or twice. Went during the weekend. The ordering kiosk lines were slow because people don't know how to use ordering kiosks. McDonald's was out of pasta but they had pizza. I was bummed because I wanted to try the pasta. I ended up ordering a regular meal you can get at any McDonald's.

Seating was easy to find and the tables were clean. Employees were helpful. The arcade upstairs seemed pretty cool and definitely unique. We didn't play any games or play in the play place. I enjoyed seeing Mac Tonight playing the piano. Next time I'll get some dessert."
12072,30,2 months ago,4 stars,Being local we try to stay away from the busy tourist places but this McDonald's is so big we really don't mind. We like the fact they bring your food to your table and the employees try their best to keep this place clean. The customers tend to be rude and push people or not say excuse me in this establishment.

12076,30,3 weeks ago,5 stars,Breakfast was hot and fresh. They had an omelet sation with Belgium waffles.
12077,30,4 days ago,3 stars,"The service is always great here. All the employees always seem willing to help you, but with the volume this store does I don't believe they have enough staff. Saw a roach crawling on the 2nd floor, and all of the food we got was cold by the time we got it. Condiments are hard to find unless you go to the register area where 75 other people are in line waiting for their food and food is marked up in price because it is a tourist acctraction. Is a cool experience once or twice, but a couple miles down the road is a regular McDonald's that has fresh food every time for the same price as a regular McDonald's."
12078,30,3 months ago,5 stars,"This is an amazing gem sitting on a corner looking not much like any McDonald's I had ever seen before.   The second floor confused me, but the logo looked similar to McDonald's.  They have pizza, cooked there in the restaurant.  I know because my order was called before my pizza was ready.  At any rate, walking through the arcade upstairs was a nice way to wait for my pizza.  I only gave 4 stars for service because the staff seemed to not be trained for customer service.  Perhaps they were simply tired or busy, but it wasn't up to the standard of typical McDonald's when I visited.  I will return next time I am in Orlando!"
12079,30,2 years ago,5 stars,"By far the best and most amazing McDonald's in the history of the world. It's even hard to imagine it as a McDonald's. Super clean, extremely friendly and helpful staff. A second floor with a massive arcade and crazy-huge kid gym (shut down due to covid hysteria :( ). Loved this place. Bring your kids!"
12080,30,a week ago,2 stars,"The first time we visited was at night, and there was a group of male teenagers sitting outside the entrance to the building asking for money in threatening and rude manners. It did not feel safe at all. We did go back a couple of days later for breakfast. The food was very good. The omlets really hit the spot. The service was good. It is advertised as having over 100 arcade games upstairs. There is nowhere near that many, and much of them are broken down and use your credits because there are no signs on them."
12081,30,a month ago,1 star,Unfortunately it's not got any better. The first time visiting this trip and they got my order wrong.... I didnt have much faith to begin with to be honest. The attention to detail here is lacking. And $5 for a latte is unreal.... Tourist trap central. Cross the road to checkers and get good food at a low price
12082,30,2 weeks ago,1 star,"With a 6 year old we visit McDonald's every so often..this place was just awful.

Ordered 20 regular mcnuggets a large fries, couple drinks and a happy meal.

45 min wait - 17 spicy nuggets in the boxes, no sauces despite the machine asking what sauces we want. Drinks are just cups, despite the machine asking what we want - self service downstairs with no instructions on how to get the milkshake we ordered as only soda fountains at the stations etc

Nuggets were over cooked, Like properly crunchy/jerky texture

Fries were literally stone cold, not even warm

Our kid loved the play centre but this isn't worth paying twice the price of a regular McDonald's for just plain terrible food and no service at all"
12083,30,3 months ago,4 stars,"Very average McDonald's experience overall. Was cool because of the whole ""largest McDonald's"" bit, but it was extremely hectic inside with kids running and screaming everywhere. Took a while to even get the opportunity to order, then food took a while to get to us, which is understandable since it was so busy. Ice was out in 3/4 soda machines. Not a very clean place either. Pizza was alright. Very dry, flavorless crust, pretty soggy and could have used more time in the oven/ the oven could be hotter. If they put like 20% more effort into the flavor of the pizza it would be a lot better. Onion ""slivers"" were also just onion chunks. Not a big deal, just a little misleading. But what else you expect from a McDonalds. Food is a little pricier than the McDonald's I'm used to as well. Would probably have a better experience making the effort to dine elsewhere."
12084,30,2 months ago,3 stars,Food was great pasta and pizza was awesome! Really thought the play area would be a lot bigger given on how this McDonald's is 2 stories. Also the arcade was small. Kids had fun that's all that matters!!!!!

I asked one of the staff (tall, skinny lady with curly hair upfront) if I could get my food cooked to order and she gave a slight nod as a response which I found extremely rude then moved over to the kitchen area so I decided to ask ANOTHER manager upfront and she was actually quite nice and went straight to telling the people in the kitchen and the moment she did the manager I had previously spoken to decided to turn around and say the slight remark ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You already told me, I got it, thanksï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which I found very rude coming from what youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½erd to my surprise yet not so surprised self I received very mildly warm food, it tasted and was very obviously sitting there for longer than I wouldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve liked + it didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t meet my simple request of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
12086,30,2 years ago,5 stars,"Not much to say that every other review hasn't. Very fun for something different. Watching your pizza be put into the real brick oven at a McDonald's is definitely interesting. The main reason you go is the novelty, but the food honestly didn't disappoint. The specialty menu items are a tiny bit pricey but fast food standards, but they really are a tier above fast food. Overall, my fiance and I had a great time and I definitely recommend checking it out."
12087,30,2 weeks ago,1 star,"The biggest waste of time and money. Way to packed. Unorganized. There was barely a line when we got to McDonald's yet we still waited over an hour for 2 bacon mcdoubles, a big Mac, a bacon chicken ranch (they forgot the bacon when it's literally IN THE TITLE) and 4 medium fries. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING was cold and disgusting. Spent way more money than it should have been. Will NOT be going back there. The kids didn't even want to play in the play area because they ended up getting hurt. Poorly set up and no security or anything. They were being pushed and shoved by other children and no one was doing anything about it."
12088,30,2 months ago,1 star,"Where should I start. Service was exceptional BAD. I was missing half of my order and had to go down stairs and bring the rest of my order they was missing back upstairs which was alot of hassle to do. Also would've been very helpful if there was a refill station upstairs.

The atmosphere, was way too overcrowded. I don't really fault McDonald's for this, but it didn't make the experience pleasant.

Overall I would skip this place if I see a parking lot full of cars."
12089,30,2 weeks ago,4 stars,"Biggest McDonald's in the world, has special menu items (pizza and pastas [don't sleep on the ravioli bolognese.]) Being it's the world's biggest, it was a madhouse inside, some kiosks down completely, some just the payment part not working. Overall, food was good, inside was a zoo, but you can only get the special items inside."
12090,30,4 months ago,5 stars,This has to be one of the best McDonald's I have ever been to hands down. While disappointingly I did not visit the upstairs with the arcade machines I can rave about the pasta and pizza they make and serve! The pasta can rival olive garden and starts at 10.99 and you are able to customize it how you want. Definitely would recommend both the pasta and even the pizza! I'm pretty picky on pizza and the pepperoni pizza was actually pretty good! I usually would HATE brick oven pizza as I find they taste burnt always but this was a good pizza! Definitely worth checking out at least once if you are in the area! It is a little busy most times but even with that the wait is no worse than a regular McDonald's.

12093,30,a month ago,5 stars,This McDonald's in Orlando is huge! It was very busy but they were very fast. The food was very fresh as they pretty much have to make everything to order. Definitely worth a visit just to see them make pizza at a McDonald's.

12101,30,2 months ago,4 stars,"Because it is the largest McDonald, it is a place where you go there so you can scratch off your bucket list.
It is very crowded,  very noisy,  a lot of kids, of course.
They have pizza, coffee, and sweets beside the regular menu.

I think the staff works hard and as fast as they can. In my opinion,  the management has to step in big time in order for this place to run flawsly.

The self order machines two or three didn't work,  so it added to the slow service.
Upstairs is an arcade game room. You need coins. It is very stuffy and even more noisy . But, as I said, a place to visit one's in a love time, so you know you did it!"
12102,30,2 months ago,3 stars,Awesome for kids you can be waiting for food and have them upstairs playing in the arcade. Although the experience is good the wait for food is crazy. My ice tea got left out of my order and the person infront of us also had something left out.

12105,30,3 months ago,5 stars,This is by far the best McDonald's.  I love the options not on other locations menus.  The pizza was wonderful and freshly made to order.  I wish I lived closer because it would for sure be my go to fast food restaurant.
12106,30,5 months ago,1 star,"Our ""World's Biggest"" McDonald's adventure started with an appetizer...an appetizer consisting of the smile and excitement of my McDonald's loving younger brother. Then came the 1st course...the tears of my girlfriend as she gazed upon her small serving of $12 pasta while her fingers felt the stone cold chill of her fries. Our meal ended with the return of my absolutely revolting Chicken Alfredo which led the the main course of a Big Mac...a Big Mac has never failed me, until today. With the measliest of beef patties and sauce on the side (yes, they missed the burger), I was astonished by the lack of quality this McDonald's provided. Also, my brother's Pizza took an hour to be served and then he was argued with. 1/10 would not recommend, fire everybody."

12108,30,3 months ago,4 stars,"This McDonald's has a huge, amazing inside playground and arcade (2nd floor). Beautiful fish tanks for the kids to look at while you are ordering. It does get a little loud when the kids scream. Plenty of tables for everyone. Order downstairs and take a number - they bring it to you. Super nice when you have difficulty walking g like I do. However drinks are downstairs. Handicapped parking in front of the doors. An elevator to the second floor and handicap tables with half booths upstairs. My neices love this McDonald's!"

12110,30,4 days ago,1 star,"Worst McDonalds experience I have had in all my life. Place was chaotic from the moment we walked in but for some reason that didn't put us off. Waited for ages to receive our food and when it did arrive, half of it wasn't there and some of it was cold. Tried to find a helpful member of staff - we're still looking... Went to get some drinks, all of which were 'horrible' as quoted by another customer, even the water tasted like sewage. We ended up leaving with what we had and wondering how long the symptoms of cholera take to set in. So safe to say we wouldn't recommend and would 100% not return. 'Horrible'"
12111,30,4 weeks ago,4 stars,Kids had a great time! Hard to find play areas these days. Great selection of arcade games. Our cheeseburgers were cold however i saw more customers opt for the pizza and philly cheesesteak.

12114,30,a month ago,5 stars,We got out food VERY fast and they even have pizza. The burger was a tad too dry but nothing I couldn't fix. Service was fast for how busy it was. It's also a very modern building!
12115,30,4 months ago,3 stars,Love the kiosk ordering and table delivery. Fries were cold. Quarter pounder with cheese seems smaller. Diet Coke seemed a bit watery than usual. Got with no ice.

The manager had no control over his staff who blatantly ignored him to the point he was telling customers their names to report. This place simply doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t work and is utter chaos. $40, almost an hour, and wrong food, with no one to care"
12117,30,2 months ago,1 star,"Fries were cold, nuggets were soft.., the burgers were gross, the upstairs smelled sweaty and gross, ordered food and the place was busy and my child needed to use the bathroom so I took the card with our number to the bathroom because I didn't want them leaving my food alone at the table and they came over and yelled at us for moving around the mcdonalds.. honestly 1/10 do not recommend. It is not worth it. Go find a  regular McDonald's and a park close by."
12118,30,2 weeks ago,1 star,"This was a horrible experience and a waste of 4 hours and almost $100. The place was terribly overcrowded and dirty. There was standing room only, shoulder to shoulder. We stood in line for 20 minutes at a kiosk to order, then after we ordered it said there was an error and we had to wait another 40 minutes in the line at the register anyway to order. All of the workers were super rude. I was even on the elevator with 2 workers talking about a customer saying ""I have no obligation to answer your questions or do anything for these people"" and then talking about how gross a customer was and saying she would point her out to the other employee. Nobody was at all helpful and even seemed to be angry when we asked for anything.  My daughter tried to fill her cup with sweet tea and the older lady standing at the drink station didnt let her fill it up all the way. The only nice person was the old guy emptying the trash on the 2nd floor. We spent over $60 for my kids to play the arcade games, then they shut and locked the prize counter. A while later, we had to ask someone to open it so they could redeem their tickets and 3 employees tried over the course of the next hour and no one could get it back open. I tried talking to a manager about it, but she gave me about 10 seconds of her time just to tell me there was nothing she could do but send someone up to the ticket counter for us... she didn't even listen to us explain that it others had tried before she just walked away. We are from out of state and my kids were so excited to see this place but we all left miserable. At least the sandwiches were warm (though the fries were soggy)."

You can order at kiosk or wait in line for cashier. Soda is not self-serve, free refill. Expect a long wait (approximately 20-30 mins) if you are waiting for pizza and pasta, it's understandable though. They do deliver to table. I didn't see the Belgium waffle on menu."

over an hour to get a Big Mac meal. Ordered a pizza that came before the big Mac meal. The pizza was very salty yeah I guess that's what you get when ordering pizza at a McDonald's. My kids ordered pasta and were also disappointed."

Ordered a Philly cheesesteak, pepperoni pizza, kids meal, big Mac meal and 2 mcdoubles.

The wait was absolutely ridiculous and when they brought us the food it was ice cold. We didn't complain because the lines were super long and nobody was around to help. The one guy picked up my daughter's kids meal thought it was trash and I told him and he said he was sorry and walked off.
The arcade was just a mad house. So busy and very dirty so was the restrooms. We don't be going back that's for sure."

12127,30,2 weeks ago,1 star,"This McDonald's did not live up to the hype I saw on the internet. It was crowded and small. I entered and all of my expectations dropped. I ordered at the kiosk since the line was long. All of the items I've seen online through social media were either unavailable or not there at all. I saw the ""famous"" pizza and pasta, I tried the pizza. After ordering my food and sweets, I waited at the only table I could find that wasn't already taken. I ordered a small drink so I figured if I had to wait maybe they would at least bring me the cup so I can get a drink, I was wrong. I made a special request for my McFlurry and within minutes of ordering, I was told my special request couldn't be done since they had already made my McFlurry. I thought they would make the ice cream items last so they don't melt while waiting for the food. I didn't order much, and I know there was a line but I received the pizza faster than anything. I waited for a total of 30 minutes for the rest of my food. They waited until everything was done to bring it to me and it wasn't even good. The chicken was dry and looked old, my burger was cold, my McFlurry was made wrong so I didn't eat that and they gave me the wrong slice of cake... very disappointed. The pizza was the only food item that didn't suck entirely. It was very thin but tasted okay. Definitely wouldn't go back ever again. Not worth the trip, or the hype."
12128,30,2 months ago,2 stars,"We thought it would be cool to visit one of the largest McDonald's in the world.  We regretted it.  The chicken sandwich and pizza were all burnt a little too much.  The ice machines weren't working very well.  The place was a mess and loud for 430 on a Sunday.  The arcade had a few money grabbers where it took your money but no game But the skeeball had a machine that let you play for free.
This place is just crazy and more expensive than my usual trip to McDonald's.  I don't need to try their pizza which isn't bad but not great either.  I would skip this or plan to come to try the pizza only as the price of pizza is fair."
12129,30,2 weeks ago,1 star,My family was dining there and the people that was with us got their food way before us. I waited for an hour before deciding to inquire about mine and my daughters pasta dishes. I stood in line for about ten minutes when a member of management came. They went to look for it. Was just sitting under a heat lamp. We will never step foot in that McDonalds again. We ordered our food at 7:34pm and got our food at 8:45pm Shame on you McDonalds
12130,30,a month ago,5 stars,It was to crowded but food was good and there are so many other options like pasta that you cant find in regular stores. The second floor was amazing for the little ones with big playgroung and Arcade section. Would love to come back on a not to busy day. We visit Sunday at noon.
12131,30,3 years ago,5 stars,"Awesome McDonald's to visit and eat. The food was delicious and the customer service was great. You place your order at the machine and they will deliver the food anywhere you are. I love the arcade area and there was plenty of seating. The atmosphere was relaxing and restrooms,food area,drink area and arcade were clean. They have 2 stories and both were very well maintained. I definitely recommend visiting this McDonald's with your children. They will have lots of fun."
12132,30,3 months ago,4 stars,"biggest in the world - but still a mcd's. the golden arches doesn't really do anything impressive - i mean, disappointment is kinda expected.  Walked in with no expectations.  I like that they have other food besides the regular burgers. was impressed by the brick oven pizzas they were putting together. we tried ordering breakfast (ALL DAY) but they were out of so many entrees... like OUT! not sure how you run the world's biggest McD's and not have stuff on hand at 2.30 in the afternoon. It wasn't super crowded. Love the self-ordering kiosk (that's what you get for demanding $15/hr for fast food wages). Love even more that you can order from your app and just go pick it up at the counter. Our fries were as expected from the golden arches.  the top floor has seating and an arcade.  the main floor has a lot of seating areas with plenty of window seating. for it being the world's biggest, it really didn't seem THAT big ... also, they could have more of a variety of entrees / foods / dishes that is different from a regular neighborhood mcd's - just a thought."
12133,30,a month ago,4 stars,The service was very slow compared to Ireland and our order was mixed up even though we ordered on the self service machines. The soft drinks were flat but otherwise no complaints.  American McDonalds burgers taste quite different to Irish Mcdonalds.

Upstairs is a big kids play place
But you will have to wait about 20 -30 mins too receive your order

Ice cream, cake, cheesecake, pizza, pasta. An arcade with prizes. A huge play area.

All of our food didn't come out together...curious how fries and a drink cup come out 15 minutes after pasta and pizza? Lol.

The pasta with Alfredo sauce was bland and not great. The pizza was delicious.

It was pretty chaotic and loud but overall clean. Workers constantly moving."

12142,30,a week ago,2 stars,"I really wanted to looooove this Mc Donalds store since they are the biggest in the world. But being this ""famous"" comes with a price: overcrowded and short staff. People were mad in the line asking for the food, saying they ordered their meal 30 minutes ago. Hello?30 minutes? This is insane. Very tourist location. I just wish the manager would hire more people to work there so they can attend that much of people."

If you have little ones you definitely want to check this place out. The Play Place is huge."

Went to ask about it three times and was told it was on its way.  The fourth time, I went to the counter to ask about the order and was told that their system went down and that It had lost the order. Little did they know that I currently work for McDonald's, and I asked the manager how they were still taking orders if the system went down and no one was on the phone with tech support. All of a sudden, they found the order and rushed it to us. I feel that what had happened is that the order was served off and no one wanted admit to it."

12173,30,2 months ago,1 star,"If I could give 1/2 a star I would!! My son & I ordered a pizza each. The server brought out 2 but only handed my son his. I commented that we ordered 2, she had 2 on the tray but still walked away telling 1 minute as she walked away w/the other pizza walking around the entire place including going upstairs!! I'm sure they wouldn't put 2 separate customers orders on the same tray. After 10 minutes I went up to the counter to ask where my pizza was as I see a different employee walking past me w/a pizza without a cover!! I turn to see where she was heading & it was to where my son was sitting. I adked her why the cover was off & she couldn't answer!! To top it all off there was hair under one of my pieces of pizz!! Shouldn't employees be wearing hairnets or have their hair tightly up & not hanging down??

I'm very disappointed w/this being my 1st time here."
12174,30,2 months ago,1 star,"Absolutely manic busy. The food was usually McDonald's fare, however chips were cold. The place seems really disorganised and half the self service kiosks were out of order (I wondered if this was to help the kitchen keep up). Homeless people coming in and raiding tables with food left. Not a pleasant experience at all and one of the worst McDonald's I have ever visited, needs security guards I feel"
12175,30,2 years ago,2 stars,"Slowest service on planet. Atleast 50+ cars left in last 30 mins while I am waiting on drive thru.
If you can staffed appropriately and efficient folks can make thousands extra without doing anything extra. Just process order with some speed and sense of urgency. Very slow service, I wonder if top management is aware of how slow is the food service in general at McDs.

12176,30,2 months ago,1 star,Gets jammed packed with tourist. If you order on the app to pickup in store instead of thru the drive thru and decide to go inside they make you get in line for counter pickup which takes even longer. Parking lot gets full with no place to park. I suggest you go to a different location if you want to order and eat and park All in one place. Terrible experience
12177,30,2 months ago,5 stars,If you haven't been here you need to see it!!! Updating Review this place is still very interesting definitely bringing the kids. food hasn't changed pizza is fantastic.
12178,30,3 years ago,4 stars,"I went here with a lot of expectations so I'm a little disappointed.  However, its pretty great place still. This place is like a mini Chucky cheese married a McDonald's and its give birth to this biggest McDonald's.  Its 2 floors with limited parking.  They do have wood fired pizza.  I wish I tried its.  The pizza looked good.  The staffs were super friendly.  One McDonald's employee went around asking how everyone was doing."
12179,30,3 weeks ago,4 stars,"-Pizza is from a Fire oven - turned out good!
-Philly Cheesesteak was also very good
-AC upstairs was struggling, was pretty hot when we went
-Kids sweatted up a storm from playing at the play place which was also warm
-We did not have any issues finding seating, have tables for big groups on the 2nd level (8 of us)"

12181,30,2 months ago,5 stars,"The staff treats people like an actual customer...There everyday practically (doordash driver). Amazing staff... One thing I hate is having to mix my own flurry when they usually mix it up for you. Other than that little flaw... I definitely feel safe, Welcomed, No rude staff. When their busy, we have to wait a 1H for the food, when their not.. we get our food within 20-30 minutes. Surely recommend bringing small kids to the play area."
12182,30,a month ago,1 star,"I can honestly say this is the world's worst McDonald's I have so far experienced. A 45-minute wait for a very simple and straightforward order. I've eaten in McDonald's all over the world, and the food quality and service let this one down severely. So many people were angry with ridiculous waiting times, wrong orders, crushed food, and items not available. I do not recommend it!"
12183,30,5 months ago,4 stars,I lived in fl. all my life and this McDonald's location is the biggest I have been 2. It has an upstairs & downstairs for seating. Upstairs also has a game room. I didn't order anything because the prices seem higher than normal. That was understandable because it's located in a tourist area. I just amazed of how it look inside. Seems like a great place 2 sit & eat with the family.
12184,30,4 months ago,5 stars,"Multi-level place. Loud but fun. Like a Chuck-E-Cheese inside a Mickey D's.

Lots of games on 2nd level. Plenty of tables. Fast service. Kiosk fairly easy to order & pay."
12185,30,5 months ago,1 star,Went through the drive through barely said our first item and was told to hold on and she just disappeared for over 5 minutes. We were being honked at by people thinking we were holding up the line. I asked for a flat white (in the UK that's what McDonald's calls a regular white coffee) she very rudely said no you can go to Starbucks for that. When we did receive our order the big Mac's were replaced with basic cheeseburgers. I definitely won't bother next time we are in Orlando.
12186,30,a month ago,5 stars,"Even though the stars make no sense on my review, the experience of a different McDonald's is definitely worth it.

The place isn't the cleanest, service isn't the fastest or most efficient, and the atmosphere a bit frantic; it's worth a visit to have a pizza or decent diner breakfast from McDonald's. Worth the experience."
12187,30,2 weeks ago,1 star,"Very slow service took over an hour, food came out separately so my food was cold by the time the rest arrived. Staff didn't seem to care. Food when it arrived was not as requested but was too exhausted to bother complaining any more."

12189,30,a week ago,1 star,Supposedly they do close for their staff to take a break and are not 24 hours. Maybe they should hire more staff or pay a decent wage. Not like they canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
12190,30,5 months ago,1 star,"Visited today. Play place was out of service. Dine in service was not available. Some of the menu items we wanted were not available Ordered food from the machine, but a staff member said he couldn't find it in the system, started to retype it in the cashier. Our order was customized and the worker made a few mistakes. When I asked what was going on, he started making rude comments and asked if I spoke English.
I asked for the refund, and the worker refunded me $3 less. Then the manager came, and fixed the refund error. The manager was calm, but didn't offer any apology.

The saddest part is - this is a flagship McDonalds location, advertised as the biggest McDonalds in the world with Play Place and Entertainment. I hoped to see exemplary service and atmosphere, but it was a huge disappointment.

I wish next time I visit (if ever) to see working services, friendly and competent staff, and adequate food selection. Peace!"
12191,30,2 months ago,4 stars,"This was, indeed, a large McDonald's.
The entire upstairs is an arcade, and playground, maybe.
It comes with the problems you might expect in the world's largest McDonald's.
Still, it's the WORLD'S largest McDonald's.
The upstairs bathroom was real small, still,
I have been and you haven't!
The Big Breakfast with Hotcakes was excellent."
12192,30,2 months ago,3 stars,"Would have given it a higher rating, but the only reason we stopped was the play area, and they decided that lunch time on a Friday afternoon was the best time to close it to do maintenance."

The way it is laid out it is very customer friendly. And the kids just love the play area and game room upstairs. To this day the staff continues to be very friendly and helpful.
12198,30,2 weeks ago,4 stars,Be prepared to spend $10-$13 per person. Clean bathrooms also. Staff is friendly and helpful with the ordering. Upstairs is wild and crazy.

It is a 2 story building that offers specialty cakes, pasta, and custom built pizzas. Also, it has a huge indoor playground for kids as well as the arcade room.

The Food.
We tried pizza and, surprisingly, it was pretty good having in mind it came from the fast food chain. Touch screen menu had enough options of ingredients to customize pizza order based on personal taste. Keep in mind that some toppings cost extra. I would rate pizza 7-8 points out of 10.

The Ambience.
This McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s is clearly a touristy, family place which is good. Also, the service was pretty quick given the locationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
12200,30,2 months ago,2 stars,"Too crowded, wait hours in line for food, just go to a regular McDonald's not worth the wait either. Waste of time in line. Arcade  is also small and not worth it, go to a bigger and better one."
12201,30,2 months ago,5 stars,"The food is good. But they are understaffed and struggling to provide food on time. It takes hours even to get a slice of cake or coffee . For pizza, the wait time was horrible."

None of the employees seemed to care that there was no social distancing. I was expecting some type of Covid policy to be in place and there was for staff. But they seemed to care less about the people who visited. I will never be going back here again."

I understand when is full, is gonna take longer to prepare the food, but after 40min paased, I asked them about my order and no knew about it and ignored me, I asked another lady, staff mention they already made it.

12214,30,5 years ago,4 stars,So it is my birthday today and I wanted to try something I have never tried in my 47 years. A McDonald's pizza or as they call it a McPizza (there are only 3 McDonald's that serve them). The Pizza and pasta were truly awesome. We did the ordering from the kiosk and proceeded to our seat. Everything was great except they didn't bring my husband's latte. So I asked the gentleman that brought the food to bring the drink. We were nearly done by the time we received it and it was incorrect. After eating we went to get the correct one and the manager had an attitude and basically filled a small cup up with milk and handed it to us. Overall the food was great. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because of the issue with the drink. We will be back but next time we will get water.
12215,30,4 months ago,5 stars,"My kids love the indoor playground.
The whole place was sticky, sweaty and stinky!. I don't know what's wrong with the a/c but a lot of people could be the reason. Keep your kids close at all times."
12216,30,3 years ago,4 stars,"A really fun experience.  So many food options.  It was easy to find vegan-friendly food.  The quality of food was about cafeteria quality but it still beat having to eat something considered regular food at this place.

12217,30,3 weeks ago,4 stars,Neat experience but dirty restaurant. We did come around 11pm and they were very busy. Husband did love the pizza.
12218,30,6 days ago,5 stars,"One of the world's largest and most interesting McDonald's. Located in the busy area right in the hub of Orlando off of iDrive.

This is a two-story McDonald's hosting some of the world's rarest menu items including both pasta and pizza and a ton of cakes and other amazing trees.

A great place to visit if you're looking for something fun and interesting in Orlando. If you're a fan of McDonald's, this is the one you're going to want to check out. Although it is always very busy because it is in the downtown tourist hub right near Universal Orlando, I drive, and many other great tourist destinations.

This McDonald's features both counter service and has multiple kiosks of available so you can go up and order easily. There is a drive-thru available.

This is currently the only place in the world serving McPizza with several options available as well as customizations. This is also one of three places in the world including the Philippines and Italy that are currently serving McDonald's pasta. Definitely an interesting menu item to try out if you're looking for something a little different. They also have a full ice cream and cake shop with plenty of dessert choices.

Upstairs host a full gaming arcade with air hockey, skiball, arcade games, and a ticket area to collect prizes once you're all done.

If you're looking for an interesting affair and a little bit of a different McDonald's experience, this is the place to visit."

There were massive queues of very unhappy customers.  Even though it was supposed to be a 24 hour breakfast place, there were no breakfast items available at all.  Some of the food was inedible and/ or cold.  I'll never return to this McDonald's!!"

As for the kids, this place offers a 3 story playground along with video games. But what makes this place special is the staff in particular Perrin. This gentleman is at your service with a smile and a great personality. I can't say enough good things about this place! You need to relax and let the kids go after a long day at the park...? This is it!!"

It was very clean although crowded assistance was given with processing our order and the employee explained how I can get a discount through the McDonald's app, he was very patient.  It is very large and the game room was great! The other employees were very nice and took our trays and trash. The was McDonald's flavor, but the pizza was good. The cookies were so fresh and warm, very delicious. More than the regular McDonald's food options. Overall a great visit!"

12245,30,5 years ago,5 stars,Best McDonald's I have ever visited. This is one of the few McDonald's in the USA that still serve pizza. On top of the coal fire build your own pizza they have custom pastas and build your own omelets. The jungle gym for the kids is huge and they bring your food right to the table. The trash cans are automatic as well as the seat covers. To add icing on the cake (which they also have at their dessert bar ) there is an arcade with a prize table. This is honestly the best McDonald's experience I have ever had.

McDonald here offer pizzas , subs , desert bar , kids playing area with arcade, amazing service "
12247,30,4 days ago,4 stars,It was good but very crowded. They have extended menu from regular Macdonald which I recommend to try.
12248,30,2 months ago,1 star,"Busy, dirty, badly organised, expensive, no vegetarian options. They are capitalising on the 'biggest' thing but it is not worth a visit! No vegetarian options. Self service machine not working, no receipts, card machine not working.  I could go on!

Edit, I will go on... the ketchup had run out, the lemonade syrup had run out, the food took over 30 minutes, there was a cup of coffee spilt on the stairs with safety cones that was not cleared up for the hour we were there."
12249,30,a month ago,4 stars,This places was crazy busy. Took 45 minutes to get our food. The play area was  a fun experience.
12250,30,2 years ago,4 stars,World's biggest McDonald's it is really cool you should see this when you're in Orlando 2 stories tall ginormous playground and arcade and they have special menu items I got the brick oven pizza that was cooked in an actual Brick Oven it was actually pretty good and cheap but the service is very slow it took them 30 minutes just to give me my food.
12251,30,2 weeks ago,1 star,"Ordered 2 hamburgers ketchup only in the drive thru.  Had to park and go in the store to take the order back 2 times to get it right...took 30 minutes total and in the process, got attitude."

12253,30,a week ago,5 stars,Very nice very crowded it's insane crazy. But the kids love it. It's a playground for the kids arcade and all.
12254,30,4 weeks ago,1 star,"Worst service ever!
45 mins for a cheese pizza! on a fast food!  My mistake trying out a pizza on a burger place...all hype biggest mcdonald...never gonna go/eat in this location again!!!! And yeah pizza tasted awful..."
12255,30,3 years ago,4 stars,"The kids had a blast! Very hectic and tons of folks are there. You order at a kiosk and then they bring your food to you. Our food arrived in an orderly time. Although, the fries were cold and we had to send them back. The kids enjoyed the play area and game area. I recommend you let your kids wear socks or bring some. Otherwise they run around the nasty floor barefooted when they are on the playground. They also have an icecream and dessert area."

12258,30,a month ago,5 stars,Super cool and fun international McDonald's! We loved the Wood Fired Pizza and all the different languages spoken there as well as the Arcade upstairs.
12259,30,3 days ago,5 stars,"This place is like WOW you'll walk in and say is this McDonald's or what ,great foods here you'll be amazed before you walk all the way in"
12260,30,a month ago,1 star,Overheard a lot of uncertainty in the kitchen. And I was knocking on the window for about 2 minutes or more just to get the sauce I ordered. It was completely unresponsive.

12262,30,10 months ago,4 stars,"We finally made it to the Biggest McDonalds!! It was a Thursday so it was busy but not packed. Line moves quickly and they bring your food to you. The play area was fun with lots of places to climb but, our let down was the arcade! The selection was ok and some were out of order. Not to mention you don't really rack up too many tickets. Over all, it was fun, food was fresh and it's McDonalds so totally kid friendly!"
12263,30,a year ago,1 star,"I Had A Bad Experience Today, My Family Food Was Late For Around 2 Hours. From 8.20 pm to 10.00. (04/28/22) Maybe Wasn't My Lucky Day. I love This Place, I've been there before and I spent a Nice Time, I don't Know What Happened. Costumer Service Tried To Solve  the Situation But They couldn't, all Costumers Were Angry.. At the end I Had to carry up  my order (incomplete) home...."
12264,30,2 months ago,5 stars,I give this place five stars because i here stayed overnight for a challenge on my youtube channel quinnotfound and you guys never caught me lol.
12265,30,2 months ago,4 stars,It was a fun experience but our food was cold and our fries were not salty. I'd go again because I would like to try the pizza and pasta.
12266,30,a month ago,5 stars,"One of the best McDonald's in my travels. Great food and great customer service. And the only McDonald's that I know that serves pizza and more! If you're heading to Universal and Island's of Adventure, make a stop at this McDonald's."
12267,30,a year ago,3 stars,"A little slow for the amount of people working. Part of the food was cold. Out of our family of 11, seven of our orders were incorrect or missing something. Whipped cream from the waffles, missing slushies, missing OJ, sandwiches incorrect. By the time we got everything tracked down, the hot food was cold. It was still very entertaining for small kids, but adults it's only okay."
12268,30,2 months ago,4 stars,"Very cool McDonald's with arcade, play place, pizza and pasta. Pasta was actually pretty good. Kids had a great time at the play place."
12269,30,6 years ago,4 stars,"This McDonald's is very impressive! It's clean, modern, it has a brick pizza oven and fresh pasta options, and a pretty decent arcade on the second level. And they bring your food to you!

Now... I ordered a maple dijon bacon bistro burger and it arrived without bacon and Dijon sauce. They brought it to me on the second floor and left before I noticed the error. I was trying to figure out how I would grab all of my stuff and my kid (who was excited about the play area) go back downstairs, get my order fixed, and avoid a toddler meltdown when I noticed an employee cleaning up. I asked him if he could get my order fixed, even though I knew it wasn't his fault or problem, and he did it happily! He even gave my son a free cookie for the inconvenience AND waited for me to check my burger to make sure everything was right. The customer service there was excellent! The burger was still lackluster ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"
12270,30,a month ago,5 stars,"The kids play area  it's speaks for itself can take your child they will play for hours ,foods good and many options to choose from pizza and a friendly staff"
12271,30,a year ago,5 stars,"Pretty chaotic inside during dinner time. Not a quick trip. Plan to stay a little while. Pasta is ok, Alfredo sauce was a little bland. Your able to customize your pasta with different meats and veggies but be prepared to pay an extra $1.50 each on top of the pasta already starting at $10.99 Pizza is phenomenal! Thin crust but not too crispy and very flavorful. All of your favorites like normal but with an actual working ice-cream machine!! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"
12272,30,a year ago,5 stars,"The worlds largest McDonald's is amazing, a two story playland plus arcade games and an updated menu where you can choose waffles, build your own omelette, pasta and pizza plus delicious desserts. It's a great place to bing the kids on a relaxing day on Orlando; don't take my word, come see for yourself!!!"
12273,30,2 months ago,1 star,"I hate to even give this 1 star as this was the WORST McD's visit ever! Waited 40 mins for 2 kids meals and 2 burger meals. Didn't get my drink, rcv'd a plain patty in a bun when i ordered a qtr pounder with CHEESE meal, no sauce for nuggets despite it being printed on my receipt which sauces I'd ordered. Got a halfa-s effort shamrock mcflurry instead of the shamrock shake I ordered. A manager was rude and yelling at every customer to move out of the way. The employees weren't friendly and ignored my kiosk help request. Just everyone I had to interact with was incredibly grumpy."
12274,30,a year ago,2 stars,Not a nice experience at all . Kids were so excited about visiting this branch as its apparently been on You tube but omg Service is Very poor . Staff seem to have been given a sentence of working in here . The food quality is questionable as well . Would not recomend at all
12275,30,a year ago,1 star,If I could give zero stars I would! We drove 40 minutes thinking the kids would get to enjoy the play area but it was closed! We even made multiple calls to the location before going to ask if the play area was open but nobody ever answered the phone! We only found out after ordering and paying for food. No signs and no indication on their website the play area is closed! The video game card advertisement is deceptive and gave our kids 30 credits instead of 30 minutes leaving the done after only two games??!! The first employee had no desire to fix the problem. It wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t till my wife finally complained to the manager. Oh and if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

12279,30,11 months ago,1 star,"Believe me when I say, I love McDonald's, but this particular restaurant is truly dreadful.
Waited 30 minutes for my first (and very probably last) spicy chicken sandwich (photo attached). You'd think with taking that amout of time it would at least resemble the menu picture in some small way, but no.
They ALMOST managed to get some sauce in there. Slightly more would have helped disguise the taste of the burnt brioche bun! I ate it for 3 reasons 1) I was hungry 2) I didn't want to wait a further 30 minutes to be served up another sad, burnt offering and 3) the dead eyes of the staff threatened to haunt my dreams for all eternity and I just couldn't face the soulsucking experience of trying to explain my disappointment to them when they were all clearly in their own personal hells.
Take my advice, if you decide to run the gauntlet of a late evening visit to this restaurant, order the pasta, not a burger, it's pretty decent if you have at least 30 minutes to wait for it. Otherwise, do yourself a favour and wander on to one of the many other restaurant choices in this part of iDrive. Wish I had!"
12280,30,3 weeks ago,5 stars,Big place haven't seen a McDonald's like this one two floors to eat and play its like a McDonald's and a chunky cheese in one recommended to every one if your in the area
12281,30,a year ago,5 stars,"Definitely worth coming inside to see everything the location has to offer.  Between the specialty menu items like ""build-your-own-pizza"" or Belgian Waffles there's over 50 menu items.  Try some hand-scooped ice cream or bakery cakes with your chicken nuggies.  Full arcade upstairs with huge Play Place."
12282,30,a year ago,5 stars,Huge McDonald's! Well staffed and looked cleaner than most location I have visited. Very busy but service was fast. There are plenty of seats in upstairs floors.
12283,30,a year ago,5 stars,Great big place for families. Games and playground.  They deliver your food to your table. Very clean and friendly staff.
12284,30,5 years ago,5 stars,"Awesome McDonalds with a huge dining and play area along with a full arcade. They offer both make your own pizza and pasta which is a unique and fun experience to create via the kiosks. All the food was good and was delivered directly to our table. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Definitely check out the USA's largest McDonalds if you can, you won't regret it!"
12285,30,6 months ago,3 stars,"We took the kids here for dinner after universal.
We made an 85.00 order. It was very loud as we sat on the second floor.
Be sure to get your drinks on the lower level. We waited 45 minutes to get our food while the kids played.
When we got our order 6 of us didn't get our food.
They deliver to your table. It took another 30 minutes to get our food corrected.
The kids had a great time. We were tired. Seating is comfortable and one young lady helped us finally get our order.
The bathrooms were very clean.
The difference between our morning trip here and the evening trip here was substantially different."
12286,30,a year ago,5 stars,Pizza wa excellent. Pasta was good but peppery.  Normal McD food was similar to others.
12287,30,a year ago,1 star,It was crazy!!!!!! We waited so long to order.  Cashier had to get manager to change a $50 every time a customer gave to her ( people are on vacation/ families orders cost!!!!). She had to get manager to over ride coupons. Then she left register to help feel orders. Unfortunately people were leaving several saying that's why chic Fila number 1 mcdonalds should hire their trainers
12288,30,3 years ago,5 stars,Not your regular McDonalds and this model would be cool to spread across the USA.... Pleasent staff clean attentive aware of needs..... PERRIN WAS A GREAT Host... Made our morning awesome we will be back next year when we are in town for the PGA show! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

12291,30,5 months ago,4 stars,It's a 2 story level McDonald's and they have many kiosk they would like you go check out that way but still had a guy on a register. They have all the usual food and them they have pizzas you can order and pasta. I got the tortellini Alfredo with chicken. It was very good. It's just insanely crowded
12292,30,2 days ago,3 stars,"it was interesting to have 2 levels, but i donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t think it was as interesting as anticipa"

12294,30,10 months ago,3 stars,"We waited for an order we placed for more than an hour, asked on several occasions if the order would be ready soon. We were told that it was being prepared (but it wasn't our order).  They checked  again and the order was cold and had been sitting there for the longest time. However, one of the workers was kind enough to redo our order. This was the second day of the vacation & we lived right next door. Haven't been back to 'this' MacDonald's since."
12295,30,a year ago,2 stars,"Very nice staff, but the reason Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m writing this review with 2 stars is because of the fish tank. They have a fish tank here overcrowded with African cichlids, an aggressive type of fish who will chase each other around, nip at each other and other fish, and sometimes even kill them. They have one Bala shark, which is a very peaceful schooling fish who should be in a group of at LEAST 4 other Bala sharks. (Schooling fish can die from stress in some cases if they are alone.)  He is being nipped at, his fins are torn, and he gets about 16 inches long full grown. There are Plecos that also get about 24 inches long full grown in there too. I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know who was in charge, I asked but apparently someone comes in to take care of them. I love the staff here! I just want to make sure their fish are being taken care of and happy. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½anld be very happy in there. :) Keep in mind the rule of fish is every inch of fish (think about how big they will be full grown) should have at least one gallon, if not two gallons of water to swim around in. The cichlids alone get anywhere between 6-8 inches, and I couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t even count how many there is in there. Bala sharks are schooling fish and get about 16-18 inches and Plecos get about 24 inches long, and they get very wide as well. V"
12296,30,3 months ago,4 stars,Nice place for kids but need more staff to keep up with the cleanliness of the place. Nats flying around by trash cans and over your food is horrible. Floors were horrible to walk on.
12297,30,4 weeks ago,1 star,"Do not come here. It is not worth it. The food never comes out hot or fresh, the employees are extremely rude, and the wait times are extremely long regardless of the time of day."
12298,30,5 months ago,5 stars,"This is a really awesome Macdonald's. Not like any other. Truly unique. It offers a lot especially for kids with an aquarium, slides, and gaming areas. Technology is awesome with individual kiosks for placing orders and service is fast and friendly. We enjoyed it. Plus they serve pizza. All the benefits of the usual McDonald's with bonuses. It's also very clean and modern."
12299,30,a year ago,5 stars,"Best restaurant we went to in Florida. Yes I'm serious. Went to 6 restaurants and McDonald's was the best one. Kindest waitstaff, great food, clean eating area. All around Best restaurant experience."

12301,30,a month ago,5 stars,Lots of different things on the menu. Kinda cool if you need a snack on vacation! Probably won't spend much time here
12302,30,a year ago,5 stars,"The gold standard for all McDonalds and on to of that, you can get pizza and pasta!   You order from the kiosk and take a tent number, get your drink cups from the cashier and find a table.  Your food will be made to perfection (not exagerating, all of our food looked as good and put together as it does on the menu photos).  There's an arcade on the third floor, stop in if you have a chance you won't regret it."
12303,30,a year ago,5 stars,One cleanest McDonald's I've ever been inside to eat in. Very fast service pizza was surprisingly good. I would eat here any day.
12304,30,4 years ago,5 stars,Hard to believe this is a McDonald's. Beautiful building and they even have a brick oven for cooking pizza! They also have a dessert bar and an aquarium. Even if you don't really like McDonald's food it's cool just to check it out.
12305,30,5 years ago,5 stars,Best McDonald's I have ever been to...it has an awesome game room...like Dave N Busters!  Kids win tickets to exchange for cheap toys....It has a large play gym with multiple slides...computers at tables for ordering or playing games...iced cream bar...etc...
12306,30,5 months ago,5 stars,Sat upstairs.  Brought food to our table. No drinks machine upstairs.  6 kids. Had to go downstairs to get drinks. Then realized they messed up my order. Still a good experience.  Note. Large family sit downstairs.
12307,30,4 years ago,4 stars,"This is the largest McDonalds I have ever seen massive two story second level has elevators and stairs and features a really nice play room for the kids and arcade room as well. They serve omelets,cake,cheescake,different flavors of icecream hard serve, woodfired pizza and pasta. Staff was friendly they even feature table service."
12308,30,6 months ago,4 stars,"We have always visited this branch when we are in Orlando. As always, food prices in this particular location is very expensive. You can not get the morning deal of $2.39 compared to other location in. South FL. It is $3.79 for chicken biscuit and if you want to add a hasbrown, it becomes  $6.79 and since you like to add a drink, you have to add $0.60 for a sweet tea. Small size hot coffee is $1.99. Still a wonderful experience since they had the place renovated. We experienced our first kiosk ordering here when it was first introduced."
12309,30,5 months ago,5 stars,This is a great family place you can let the little ones run around the place is so clean and sanitized.  This McDonald's has a pizza restaurant within the same building as well so I find that to be a bonus. McDonald's service was friendly and fast and fresh so thanks.

This is a whole new level of bad management. One hour wait time for a normal order plus a pizza. - The employees seem to all be very busy and there are plenty of them too. This leads me to believe management are not equipped to handle a location this size and either needs training or needs

12313,30,3 years ago,3 stars,"This place is massive, and a mad house! It was fun to  check it out, and they have more than the typical McDs menu - with brick oven pizza and a dessert counter - and even an arcade room upstairs where you can earn cheap prizes. Self service kiosks are nice, but chaotic, and a wifi location tracking number leads a server to your table to bring your food. For as long as I waited and as busy as it was, I expected hot and fresh food, but my tenders were room temperature at best, and the fries looked a day old."

It is definitely really fun. The pastas and pizzas were surprising
12315,30,a year ago,5 stars,"Very busy, but It's nice and different types of food. From cakes to pasta and even pizza. Had the pizza and chicken alfredo they were surprisingly good and easy to go down. Doesn't compare to a good restaurant. But if your craving pizza or pasta can't go wrong"
12316,30,a year ago,1 star,"Totally, not worth it. I've received better service and food at standard McDonald's locations. The prices are ridiculously high for a McDonald's, the people are ghetto, and the facility could have been a lot cleaner."
12317,30,3 years ago,4 stars,"This is obviously the coolest mcdonalds I've been to. An arcade, little bakery, pizza, pasta and a cheesesteak!? Plus all the mcdonalds food you know of. I'm not giving it 5 stars because after waiting over 20 minutes and seeing others get their food and not have gotten my order yet, I had to go up to the counter and ask for it. But, the cashier was nice, gave me some extra nuggets for the wait and all was forgiven.

I recomend checking this mcdonalds out at least once in your life. Its definetly not like the one you are used to. Plus, open 24/7."
12318,30,4 years ago,4 stars,One of the best maccys I've seen. We don't get them the same scale here in the UK.  However during our visit on the middle floor there was female  drug addict camped out in the disabled restroom. Who went into the ladies restroom and blocked a member of our party from leaving and asked her for money. Fortuntely another member of the public went in and out party member returned.   Other than that. Really liked the place

12321,30,11 months ago,5 stars,"The McDonald's pizza is surprisingly good! This particular restaurant is gigantic and well staffed, meaning there is always plenty of seating and service is quick and accurate. This is a fun stop when in Orlando, especially if you are heading east after visiting the Diz."
12322,30,11 months ago,3 stars,This is supposedly the world's biggest McD. I wanted to see what makes it so popular. Frankly speaking it's just another McD. No special food. Although the dessert section had sugar loaded yum desserts.

12325,30,a year ago,5 stars,Was very busy. But food was great and made quickly. We didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t get a chance to go up stairs because of the crowd but the kids enjoyed the fish tank
12326,30,3 years ago,4 stars,Fun place! Biggest MCD's in the country. Service is fast and friendly. Love the extra food selections! Kids really enjoy the arcade upstairs as well.
12327,30,6 days ago,5 stars,Great experience I got my pizza fast and overall it was great the pizza was well made.
12328,30,6 months ago,5 stars,"Ok, it's complicated. Its always crowded because of its location but this McDonald's is just unique!! I believe the biggest and if you enjoy McDonald's you are going to love this one. And the pizza and pasta, ""yes you read correct"" is delicious. Its like there own recipes and they got it right !!!"
12329,30,a year ago,5 stars,"The pasta was incredible! It was a fair price and the flavor was on par with other more expensive pasta resturants. Overall great experience, the service was good and the restaurant looked clean. No complaints."
12330,30,2 months ago,2 stars,"Absolutely horrible McDonald's, the staff were rude and over worked. They didn't help you in any way at all. I waited 30 minutes for a coffee and when I went to ask for the cup to pour my own I got snapped at."
12331,30,3 years ago,5 stars,Has to be the best McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s I have been in. They say the World biggest Mcdï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
12332,30,3 years ago,5 stars,"This is the biggest McDonald's in the world, has an upstairs with arcades and child's play area.

Menu is extensive, with pasta, pizza, omelettes and all day breakfasts!

If you visit Orlando and like a cheeky McDonald's, be sure to visit here!"
12333,30,a year ago,4 stars,"Nice organization, overall clean enough. The food took a while to come and my order needed a lot more salt than it had.
The arcade area was fun! You can pay 5 dollars to have unlimited credits for 30 minutes, not so bad (you can't earn prize tickets with this unlimited mode though)."
12334,30,6 months ago,2 stars,"""Hostess"" at the entrance had no desire to be there and wasn't shy about showing it, same went for the cashier. If you're used to Canadian prices... expect to pay almost double that. Crispy chicken had pickles on it and that's it, no sauce or anything... it also tasted like fish. Do not recommend. Beyond disappointing for being an ""attraction""."
12335,30,5 months ago,3 stars,"It didn't seem like the largest McDonald's in the world. But it was big to the point it had an arcade and place where the kids could crawl thru tunnels and go down slides.  The kids had fun. I do not eat from fast food places like McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King etc.... So I can't tell you how the food taste."
12336,30,4 months ago,5 stars,"Very clear local, kindly staff and I loved the pizza"
12337,30,6 months ago,4 stars,I visited this McDonald's only for the fame it has. What makes it special is the new menu items pizza and spaghetti. Also the arcade and the top floor is very nice. My food didn't take long and the restaurant was very busy specially on Thanksgiving holiday. 8/10
12338,30,a week ago,2 stars,Be ready for a 45 min to 1.5 hr wait for food.  For McDonald's food??? The line for cancelli ng orders was surprisingly long!

Waited over an hour for food, which was cold when it finally arrived. Had to go back to the line to get our shake and a sundae. While waiting for those, talked to multiple others who had also waited over an hour for food and one who waited over 30 minutes for coffee (he aske"
12340,30,a week ago,3 stars,"It's McDonald's on steroids lol never have I  thought pizza and pasta be on the menu here. Wish I tried it before leaving the area, but it was very chaotic inside."
12341,30,4 months ago,4 stars,"Same mc McDonald's new experience. They offer foods not on the menu at other McDonald's, such as fruity pancakes and pizza. The best part, however, is being able to order breakfast items all day. It also features a second story with playplace and odd singing moon character that plays piano. Parking, however, is hard to find even at the best of times."
12342,30,a year ago,5 stars,Fun tourist feel. Kids will go crazy. Nice small arcade. Please ask the crew for help in cashing in winnings they don't have a separate team working the arcade.
12343,30,a year ago,3 stars,"While this is a fun mcdonalds with a huge Playland and an arcade, the service is lacking. We ordered and they bring your food to you. We waited at least 20 minutes, went to the counter to check and then they gave us only part of what we ordered. I went back and got the rest, no apology, no compensation....."
12344,30,a week ago,1 star,The indoor playground was close on a saturday. So many families complaining that they traveled to bring their kids here.
12345,30,9 months ago,5 stars,Food was great and they even served pizza and pasta. Multiple stories with playground and arcade games
12346,30,a year ago,5 stars,"Best McDonald's I've ever been to. Good quality food, especially for a fast food restaraunt. This McDonald's also had a very fun-looking game room."
12347,30,6 years ago,3 stars,"The food was good except my husband found a hair on his sandwich. They have pasta, pizza, and different desserts in addition to the regular meal. There is a huge play area and arcade upstairs. It's fun but nothing special. I felt the food was a tad over priced considering our regular sandwich meal was $10 each."
12348,30,3 years ago,5 stars,"You don't see a McDonald's with two-story anywhere until you come to Orlando, Florida. Just because of the size, I forced my family for us to eat here. They had a whole arcade area, pizza line etc. You have to check it out when you visit Orlando."
12349,30,4 months ago,5 stars,They forgot to give me cup for my coffee after waiting half hour. And when I went to ask for refund. They gave refund without any hassle and also offered free Apple pie for the inconvenience. And they still gave me cup for coffee. Staff are friendly. Huge play area for kids.
12350,30,3 months ago,2 stars,"Come on people, this place is so dirty and gross. Didn't try the pizza or pasta, but felt like I waS touching every virus known to man. My Big Mac was cold and no sauce. I was standing there when it was put up."
12351,30,a year ago,5 stars,"Wow this McDonald's is different. First of all there's 2 floors. The first floor is essential just for dining and ordering. It is very different than a normal McDonald's however. Then on the second floor, which you can access via stairs or elevator, features a full fledged arcade and children's play area alongside some more eating areas. This McDonald's is a tourist attraction in and of itself. For sure worth a visit, even if you just go to see it because it's pretty cool. They also happen to serve McDonald's Pizza and Pasta too."
12352,30,8 months ago,3 stars,"Nice McDonalds, but pricy for just getting drinks. Medium soft drink $2.39? Really? Ok, call me a cheapskate, but thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a little p"
12353,30,a week ago,5 stars,Best McDonald's menu and play ground area I ever seen in my life .
12354,30,2 days ago,5 stars,"The food was good!! The soda was a little weak, but that's not what I go there for anyway. Fast service. Very efficient. The arcade staff could be a little friendlier. But overall we had a great experience."
12355,18,3 months ago,4 stars,"We've been here multiple times and always thru the drive thru. Today, we actually ate inside for lunch. Today, the food was pretty good. Previously, it was ok to good, occasional messed up orders. Regardless,  we will continue to come back."
12356,18,2 months ago,1 star,"The low score is for the Maroon Shirt Manager on 4.3.23 who took the phone off the hook and still allowed the app to sell curbside orders that would never be delivered due to the phone being off the hook. Then, making people sit in the lobby and ignore them while she sat and ""responded to surveys."" Well ma'am  here is one for you, since apparently surveys take president over service.

It took the Blue Shirt Manager realizing nothing was being done up front to get anything done. She realized the Maroon Shirt Manager had the phone off the hook for 4 hours, apologizing, correcting issues, and holding people accountable to get anything going.  To her, I am sorry that this is a low scoring survey. She deserves better than that."
12357,18,4 weeks ago,1 star,"The WORST!! We use drive-thru/curbside pickup because we have busy lives. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve sat at both, for over 25min. When the manager Nathan picked up the phone, he sounded upset because I was calling. He said he would look into my order, because he was currently busy, getting orders"
12358,18,2 months ago,5 stars,"Gas station McDonald's, adjoining but separate from the station's Timewise convenience store. (Bathrooms in-between, which were clean and multi-stalled.) Staff appeared to all be wearing masks, which is appreciable given their position of making food for and interacting with such a confluence of travelers from far-flung corners as they must. Food quality was on the high-side of McDonald's very small margin of differentiation. Only hic-up is that the space is not built for intimate conversations, and since they don't yell at you over the ambient hustle and bustle, I had some difficulty hearing the teller taking our order, as well as (though at a near table) did not hear our order number called -- hence I took off a star for ""ambiance"" in my rating here."
12359,18,a month ago,5 stars,"This was actually the fastest McDonald's I've ever been in for the drive-thru. I ordered on the app, go to the pay window, waited about a minute and a half, got my drink then my food and I'm finally I was on my way. I wish other McDonald's were just as fast."
12360,18,2 years ago,4 stars,"Good McDonald's usually connect to a Travelwise gas station but due to covid it's no longer connected. Additionally, there is no dining in. You can only get food through the drive-thru. My drive-thru order is always correct. I usually have a special order of no pickles and it's always correct."

Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll come here for breakfast/lunch and the staff is always super friendly and kind, the food is always hot, and they give you a cookie with your order when placed through the app! Donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"
12362,18,3 years ago,5 stars,"This McDonalds stands out from the others. It has great management, friendly fast service, and the food always taste like it should. The restaurant is ALWAYS clean and its connected to a convenient store if you need to grab other things as well or need to get gas. Great location that puts you right back onto the highway if you are traveling and has clean restrooms for the kids!"
12363,18,6 months ago,2 stars,"I was on my way to work in the morning, I waited almost 10 minutes just for service. The young petite lady with some what red,short, straight hair and wearing a hat, was rude, impatient and basically I was bothering her. But as I got to the window another sweet and friendly girl took my payment. But as I got my food from the first rude girl, she had this look on her face, like leave already. I am a morning person, I'm always nice to everyone even when I'm treated disrespectful."

12368,18,5 months ago,4 stars,"I went through the drive-through at this Mc Donalds and had no issue with ordering. However, it did take unusually longer to go through the Drive Thru.

To that end, the food was hot and fresh. However, they did overstuff the bags with my order. As when I got one of the bags ripped and my food fell on the floor.

Lastly, if you go to this McDonalds be sure to double check if the bag is overfilled and ask for an additional bag if you need it. Besides that, everything else was fine."

It's been that way for years and the other day I went through for the 1st time in 4 years and had the exact same result since I lived in the neighborhood adjacent to this McDonald's. Nothing has changed in 4 years, that has to bad thing right?"
12382,18,a year ago,5 stars,Longtime customer. This afternoon I was pleased to see the dining room open again with limited hours.  I would like to point out that this particular crew and manager tonight provided most excellent service. And the manager was great at keeping employees motivated which I don't often see elsewhere. And the food was excellent. Fries were just right and the Mc Rib was great. Quite frankly this may have been my best McDonald's experience ever! Keep up the good work!
12383,18,6 months ago,4 stars,"It's McDonald's not a Michelin Star restaurant. Service wasn't the best, then again it was 11pm on a Saturday. Fries were lukewarm, McFlurry was watery, and the cashier needed an attitude adjustment. But if you're in need of a late night snack after a night out look no further!"

12385,18,a year ago,1 star,"I've been to this McDonald's twice now and it's never been faster than 30 minutes. Even with a simple order like fries and a drink.
Ordered mobile and it took over 30 minutes for my order and I watched everyone standing in line to order get ignored for 20 minutes at a time. Which, after reading reviews seems like it is the norm to wait 30 minutes for a single mcgriddle.
After I waited over 30 minutes for my order, they forgot my drinks (which I waited at the counter for another 5 minutes before anyone even asked what I needed) and my order was wrong. But I wasn't about to sit another half hour for them to remake a different sandwich. Not a big deal.
Not the employees fault necessarily... just seems like they're EXTREMELY  understaffed!
Shame on upper management for allowing this to happen. I wouldn't want to work in that environment either."
12386,18,7 months ago,1 star,"Ordered curbside to go, sat in spot #3 for 20 min and never received my food. Had to take my sleeping child inside. Food was prepared but never brought to the car, by the time i got home it was all cold. Do not recommended this location."

12390,18,a year ago,1 star,"Mobile ordered food and waiting about 30 minutes before going in and asking. The young man who helped me was very nice but the other man who was working the counter was AWFUL. He called a mans order once and while said man was getting up to go to the counter the worker said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Oh? Not here? This is trash then!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ And threw the order away. It had net even been 30 seconds since he called out the order. When the young man who was working on my order stepped away to grab something the man grabbed my bag and asked what it was and why it was sitting there and started to throw it away. Luckily the one helping me stoped him and finished my order. While I understand they were busy but that is no way to act. This is by far the worst experience Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve ever had at this location. Thinking it .
But today- I will never order here again and will be in contacting corporate about their behavior. After 40 minutes of waiting I go inside and ask for my food and a refund. They argued with me that I hadnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t ordered when you can see of the app the exact time my order was placed.

12395,18,a year ago,5 stars,"Generally fast service, accurate orders.   This particular McDonald's is attached with a gas station and is often pretty busy but the line does tend to move quickly.   I do often check my order to ensure I receive my order accurately - for example I get the ketchup or dipping sauce I asked/ordered with my meal -and generally the orders are accurate.  The lines may take a bit more time but again this particular location is at a busy intersection and the next close McDonald's is going to be in Boerne."
12396,18,a year ago,2 stars,McDonald's is good comfort food when you need a bite. Still wish they could improve on customer service and adding ketchup to the fries. Disappointing only because it's a multi billion dollar corporation that can't get the simple things right.
12397,18,a year ago,4 stars,"They have started to give a full slice of cheese when you order one on Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, and that was a real problem before in which they used to give half of a slice extra. This is a fast location and food is consistently fresh, so now this location has the highest rating I've given a fast food chain yet to date. Kind of never thought I'd give McDs a 4 star, but I did."

I just can't support McDonalds at this time, not in-til they get over their very twisted views on the current situation.

I don't like to accept orders from McDonald because of this, but I have to make money.  This place needs to get their stuff in gear.  It's a busy place and not really any competition."
12405,18,a year ago,2 stars,"Cannot comprehend why @McDonald's has employees posted in the drive thru lanes taking orders well out of view of the menus. This just frustrates and delays customers for no reason.

If you are trying to be like Chick-fil-A, you're facilities were not built to serve that operating model nor are your employees trained to work that way efficiently.

McDonald's used to be a place to dash into for a fast meal but it's faster to go and dine inside most any other restaurant at this point.

Food was up to standard and only reason I gave  ï¿½ï¿½"

Food was great, but can't really give proper rating cause of this. I enjoy McDonald's, but I getting a bit feed up with the dining closure everywhere. Please do not reply due to pandemic, and safety, due to other establishment being open. I travel a lot on the road and soon will be passing up every McDonald's due to this.

12413,18,a year ago,1 star,"Lobby still closed even though Whataburger and everyone else has opened up.  So, you get to spend 20 to 30 minutes waiting in the drive through line to place an order that half the time they screw up.  Happened again today.  A simple #1 meal with a coke.  Got only the Big Mac and nothing else.  Pointed it out to the lady and handed her the bag back.  She disappeared for few minutes and when she returned with my order, shoved it at me and rudely turned away like it was all my fault.  This is probably the worst run McDonald's in the area.   Don't recommend it at all."
12414,18,a year ago,1 star,"Don't ever try ordering online for pickup here. If you do you had better bring the device you ordered on. They don't care If that's a phone, tablet or desktop computer they expect it to be here before they will ""release"" the food to you. My wife ordered pur food so that she didn't have to relay everyone's orders over the phone to me. Got to the restaurant and they literally wanted me to drive home and get my wife's phone for ""security' reasons. They also took no responsibility saying it's our falt for not being normal and brining the device like everone else and wouldn't offer any solutions. We ended up canceling the order and going to Chick-fil-A who by the way my wife ordered online and they let me pick up without needing the device. I called corporate and they said in this situation the staff at this location should have just asked for the order number and brought me the order."
12415,18,2 years ago,2 stars,"I have to do this cause I'm upset with McDonald's as a former employee but also a business partner (if you can call Doordash a business partner)

They don't pay enough, so the employee turnover rate is high or they just don't show up, they have seemingly no limits on how many delivery and mobile orders people can place so they get backlogged, swamped, and can't keep up.

I parked, called, told them I had an order and they said to get in the drive thru. By the time I got to the window; they hadn't even started the order. It took 20 minutes in total. I lost money waiting on McDonald's.

Seriously, reformat your business structure. It was embarrassing working here and apologizing for the ineptitude of this company.

Be nice to the employees, it's not their fault. I'm not even sure it's the manager's fault, but they have to tell their higher ups about this."

12420,18,3 years ago,2 stars,"Very poor service! While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee. Upon entering the McDonald's the floors were extremely dirty, but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush. Then when I stepped up to the counter to order, the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 advertisements. Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha  Coffees. After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager. Come to find out the machine is on auto-clean and it will be 18min before our coffee is ready. Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees. When I tell them that regular coffee is 1$ a cup and I was charged 7.58$ for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food. That's nice and all, but we did not want nor need any food. I ask for just a refund at that point. Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there. The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained. While they were nice and tried to make it right, I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary. While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their food. I dont often go to McDonald's but continued visits with poor service has definitely left a bad impression!"

12422,18,2 years ago,1 star,"I had revise my earlier review, left underneath this new one.

Just had the most bizarre experience. The lady who took my money at the first window seemed to have a problem with me wanting my change back. She FOLLOWED me to the other window, and started harassing me BETWEEN the barriers meant to stop the spread of Covid 19. Multiple times she stuck her face between the windows to berate me. She asked me what else I was waiting for after I got my drink. As I had just given her my money, she shouldn't be handling my food at all, much less trying to talk to me and knew I had a burger. She then closed the window, and started throwing a coniption that I couldn't hear. The then reopened the windows, stuck her face between the barriers and told me she knew what I had ordered. I told her I didn't understand, and she shoved her face further out and repeated she knew what my order was again, closer and more loudly. I don't get it, I've been here many times and gotten my food without any problems. This young lady not only made the food leave a bad taste in my mouth, but she is exposing people to the potential life threatening virus for no reason. Very very poor attitude and dangerous actions because I wanted my change?

Great, they have really turned things around in the last couple years. The service used to be slow and highly inconsistent. These days, despite all the challenges the restaurant industry has faced they overcame whatever had been stopping them from providing the McDonald's Standard, fast food with correct orders. Not sure if they got new management, training, or equipment, but these guys have brought back the Gold (Arch) Standard. Great job team!"

12471,18,a year ago,5 stars,"Always reliable and consistent flavors.
Great location. Great service.
Options for everyone.
Not open yet, but curb side pick up and drive through available."
12472,18,3 years ago,1 star,"You all need to step up the game. My order is almost always wrong, especially the kids meals for some reason...just like today...I asked for apples and of course didn't get them. Shocker.
Girl at the 1st window in a camo jacket was rude and generally unhappy sounding.
Terrible!!
Update:we ALSO got a toy in the happy meal with a coupon for a ticket to six flags that expired in 2017!"
12473,18,4 years ago,5 stars,"I went through the drive-thru; service was fast and efficient,  just as I expected it to be. The staff was courteous and even provided me with extra napkins when I asked for them. The food was hot and good. What more could one want?"
12474,18,a year ago,5 stars,"I'm normally not a McDonald's customer,but, today I tried their crispy chicken sandwich and it was very good. Fast, friendly service as well( one of McDonald's trademarks)"
12475,18,a year ago,1 star,This is the 3rd time in a month that we have ordered food from this store and have not received even close to what we have ordered. Would avoid this location at all cost from here on out. Continually going down hill and poor and slow service.
12476,18,a year ago,1 star,"Friday night 10:45 pm. Dining room still closed. There are about 6-7 cars in line behind the person who just ordered when an employee comes out and tells us SORRY, WE STOPPED TAKING ORDERS BECAUSE WE CLOSE AT 11...."
12477,18,11 months ago,4 stars,"Little slow getting order out but it was nice, hot and fresh!"
12478,18,2 years ago,1 star,"Just trash service.... just waited 40 minutes in a drive thru (after paying) just walk in and grab my own food and barely get a im sorry... they tried to bring me the wrong order took my receipt and NEVER came back, I walked in to get my own food.  Absolute worst experience ordering food in a drive thru... NEVER AGAIN"
12479,18,3 years ago,1 star,Why would you ask me when im ordering if i want any condiment if ur just going to forget them. Fries are raw and my sandwich patty was hard but yet they still some how managed to smush the sandwich in half. Atlest they wore able to get the drink right.
12480,18,2 years ago,5 stars,McDonald's is always a treat. If in a big hurry I get a double cheeseburger with a large Dr. Pepper.  Or on hot South Texas days a vanilla ice cream cone hits the spot. Yum!!!
12481,18,a year ago,5 stars,"My daughter and I love the quality of service that we receive here, and the great tasting food. My family and I are truly thankful."
12482,18,2 years ago,1 star,This McDonalds is a hot mess.   I live near it and regret coming here every time I do.    Always out of something or a machine is down.     Tonight I sat in the drive through for 15+ min just sitting here watch the drive thru guy freak out over his computer not working...only to be told a machine is out.   Get it together!
12483,18,2 years ago,1 star,"Not only does this location routinely forget items we paid for, tonight they served us a RAW burger (and also forgot food!) and Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"
12484,18,4 years ago,1 star,Just had the worst meal. Fries were limp and very cold. Chicken nuggets tasted like cardboard; my kids wouldn't even eat them. The lettuce on my chicken sandwich was unrecognizable and brown. Utterly disgusted doesn't even cover it.
12485,18,4 years ago,1 star,"Not to be mean but Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d say this is Probably up there with one of the top 5 worst McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve gone to and I find that funny because itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s, my standards really are not that high. Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"
12486,18,5 years ago,1 star,"I like the food here but I can not stand that manager Franklin. I've gotten a degree in psychology and he displays so many abusive traits. He was so badgering to a few of his workers. Also a male and female worker were hugging and being unprofessional. I could only read the female's name tag and it was Stacy. Please be careful with who you promote as manager. I won't come back, unless I hear about a change in management."
12487,18,a year ago,1 star,The staff was slow getting orders out that were taken in the lobby and they got at least 3 people's orders wrong while I was there waiting for my #2 breakfast combo for literally 15 minutes
12488,18,5 years ago,1 star,Fries were cold and I ordered a Large size ($2.80+tax) that was only filled half way. I asked them if they could please fill them up and she literally put just a few more on top and when I stood it up it was just a little over half way now. They wouldn't even pass the edge of the front part. When I showed it to her she got annoyed and closed the window. Very rude employees
12489,18,a year ago,1 star,I get about half a box of fries every time i go. Its really frustrating how stingy they can be with french fries. I order a large and get less than a small. Also I'm very upset with the price changes of already overpriced trash.
12490,18,2 years ago,1 star,"Just left,  was hu gry , got home and my quarter pounder is raw !!! The nuggets were old and cold , really?? Had to.just throw out and make a sandwich.  My 6 year old wasn't happy , she wants all week for her nuggets.  She gets a 6 piece and shares the 20bpiece with me."
12491,18,8 years ago,2 stars,"I no longer will be going to this McDonalds on my commute from San Antonio to Kerrville once or twice a week . I was there today , and this is not the first time its happened, I ordered one thing and receive something not even close to what I ordered. I'm always in a hurry so I forget to check the bag. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich combo and when I finally was able to open the bag and opened the container I had a bacon cheeseburger with onions on it, not happy. Also the tea is never the same its always way too sweet are not sweet at all .  I did call the manager this time because I was fed up, he acted like he didn't even care. I would not recommend this McDonalds."
12492,18,11 months ago,4 stars,Just too much in a little bitty area need bigger lines and some type of space I get in side a convince store but it's still alright
12493,18,11 months ago,4 stars,My kid's happy meal didn't get a drink nor toy.
12494,18,9 years ago,1 star,"It doesn't seem to matter what time of the day you go here, it is always going to be a 15-20 minute wait to get your food and that is after you have ordered. It's another 5-10 minutes to wait to order. It seems that they focus solely on the drive-thru versus the counter."
12495,18,3 months ago,5 stars,Love how friendly and quick they are.
12496,18,4 years ago,1 star,"Was not very impressed with this location service was awful 2 people in line ahead of me wife used restroom took my place in line I used the restroom came back waited close to ten more minutes for our order to be taken mind you only three customers we ordered two 20 piece nuggets fryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s and drinks CHECK YOUR ORDERS HERE!!!!!!!

12497,18,2 years ago,5 stars,Working in the field with vehicles that fit the drive thru the manger was kind enough to help me out. not to many restaurants in the area plz be in charge real cant get away from the job site. Thank you sir. really apriciate it. Was starving.
12498,18,5 years ago,1 star,"When I was there a manager named Franklin was very unhelpful and rude and I wish I could just give him 0 stars!! He was even humiliating his workers. As a person of virtue, I can not allow this to go unnoticed. All other services was ok but it was just the manager who was the problem at this establishment."
12499,18,4 years ago,1 star,"Stop! Abort! Do not drive thru! No lie...we got there and there was a line. One car at the speaker another car and then us. Many cars came after us. 25 minutes we got to the speaker. We were trapped in line. By that time one of us went inside, placed our order and came back just after we reached the speaker. We were seriously going to go over the curb, thru the lava rocks and leave when the 3 cars behind us started backing out. Not even exaggerating. There were 7 cars behind us 5 in front of us. Never has a McDonalds been this slow."
12500,18,4 years ago,1 star,"I have been here a handful of times as I live in the area, every single time the food is old and cold. Drive to the RIM if you have time. I keep trying again bc the location is convenient but never again...
I will say the servers are very nice but what youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
12501,18,2 years ago,1 star,I ordered a double quarter pounder with cheese meal the fries were good but I took one bit out of the burger only to discover the patties were not fully cooked
12502,18,3 years ago,4 stars,The McRib sandwich was great and what a deal 2 for $6.  Of course a Mc Donalds stop is not complete without fries.  Got a small order watching my carb intake but should have gotten a medium or large.  Love the fries!
12503,18,4 years ago,4 stars,"This is a very busy McDonald's attached to a gas station at a very busy intersection. The guy at the register had a very strong accent and was difficult to understand at times....nice, but hard to understand. We were fortunate to sit next to the same guy we just saw panhandling at the intersection."
12504,18,4 years ago,1 star,Slowest service ever. Didn't realize fast food took 45 minutes. If we weren't stuck in a line we should have exited a long time ago.
12505,18,3 years ago,1 star,"Ordered 3 double cheese burger fries combos all were cold,the cheese wasnt even melted Fries were burned and i ordered a 10piece nugget asked for sauce at drive thru and at window when i get home nothing.plus plus i ordered 2 fish Sandwiches also asked no tarter sauce
Cause i cant stand it,they added it on both sandwiches
Usually yall dont fail me but IDK what happen this time."
12506,18,6 years ago,2 stars,"Super slow. Trouble getting our order right even after repeating it back twice. Order was right, food that came out wasn't.

Once again with McDonald's, if you must eat here the breakfast burritos are your best bet. And Diet Coke. McDonald's does Diet Coke right."
12507,18,2 years ago,5 stars,Yep...a gas station Mc Donald's. Lobby is currently closed (9/19/2020). Good place to stop and empty the family and fill the car on your way west of San Antonio.

12509,18,3 years ago,2 stars,"Good like any other McDonalds in the world, but this location like Chic-fil- a here in Abilene  need to do something with the traffic jams they cause!! Franchise owner need to stop by and use the drive thru and feel the Pain!!"
12510,18,4 years ago,2 stars,Food not always fresh. Found a hair in my cheseburger and hardly ever any fresh sweet tea and staff not real friendly. Just this location Ive been to other McDonald's and no problems.
12511,18,3 years ago,5 stars,"My favorite thing that I have been getting from McDonalds is the chicken biscuit meal and I add folded egg and cheese that comes with a hashbrowns and a drink which is always half sweet and half unsweet. And it is the best I highly recommend it if you want a hearty meal with meat and ""breakfast"" food. So I highly recommend it."
12512,18,2 years ago,1 star,"This is the worst establishment I've ever been in. Everyone is scrambling around like they are doing something yet nothing is getting done. Stood at the counter for about 8 minutes and no one took my order, or even acknowledged me for that matter..... HORRIBLE!!!!!"
12513,18,4 years ago,1 star,"They redesigned the inside and it's Extremely Loud and noisy because the children's area is wide open to the area where adults would be sitting and you can't even hear the TV's it's so loud from the kids I will not be eating inside of this McDonald's ever again! Also, felt PUSHED, to use a Kiosk instead of the 2 girls at the COUNTER, why have ANYBODY UP FRONT IF US AARP PPL can't use their services? Never again!!!"
12514,18,a year ago,2 stars,Fries not fresh and sandwich was weirdly falling apart. Consistently not a great experience at this drive thru.
12515,18,10 months ago,1 star,Drive thru employee was rude yelled at me because i didnt know about rewards app
12516,18,2 years ago,3 stars,Average Mcdonald location. Long drive thru line and they were not up to date with the specials. Received food that tasted kind of old and no customer service
12517,18,4 years ago,5 stars,"Fresh, hot breakfast and friendly service. Great visit."
12518,18,a year ago,1 star,No option for pickup no entering the dining room to order. Think about people who are pulling trailers. There is no way to eat here
12519,18,3 years ago,4 stars,This McDonalds is pretty solid they are usually quick and there is never a super long line but occasionally they will leave out the sauces for nuggets and itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï
12520,18,7 months ago,3 stars,Basic McDonald's but clean and staff has always been friendly.
12521,18,4 years ago,5 stars,Food is fresh and the service is always in a timely manner. I work in the oilfield so most of the time I have to get food on the go. McDonald's in Pecos will always have my business.
12522,18,6 years ago,2 stars,"2 stars instead of 1 only because it could always be worse... fries, just warm. Double quarter pounder with cheese, just warm tending towards cold and the meat looked really dark, like I would expect a black bean burger to look like - disgusting. The mayonnaise tasted slighty weird too; I thought it might be miracle whip for a second. Shares a fairly nasty restroom in the hallway between McDonald's and Exxon. Over $8 for this junk is terrible."
12523,18,2 years ago,1 star,"Just like the rim location, this place has closed early without any posted signs.  This is becoming almost an everyday thing and the 24hrs is not being followed.  Try whataburger or taco cabana across the highway instead.  Very disappointing to see this over and over again."
12524,18,6 years ago,1 star,"Ridiculous service, never been so disappointed over food. I asked for a kids meal 4 PC nuggets and I get a box of mayonnaise. I don't know what kind of people they hire, or what their standards are to work at a fast food place but this is not acceptable."
12525,18,5 years ago,3 stars,Its the only McDonald in our neighborhood so there will be a longer wait than other mcdonlds you'll go to.  They hold a lot of school events which make parking very difficult to find.  Other than that the people are really helpful and friendly.
12526,18,3 years ago,5 stars,Ordering and recieving was fast and to the point. Doesn't always play out that way but this time at this location it went perfect. No long wait and order was correct. Thanks
12527,18,6 years ago,1 star,"Worst McDonalds!  I've been here before and they have always been slow. Tonight was horrible. Only 5 cars ahead of us in the drive thru didn't seem too bad. Wrong! 35 minutes later we finally got our order and of course, it was wrong. Will not be back!!!"
12528,18,2 years ago,1 star,Almost bit into this bug! Come on McDonald's really!
12529,18,4 years ago,2 stars,When you go to McDonald's you are expecting fast and consistent food. Not the case here. My order came out 16 minutes after I ordered and the sandwich was on the wrong bread.
12530,18,a year ago,1 star,This location is ALWAYS slow. My order is constantly wrong. The line takes FOREVER. Avoid and go some place else.
12531,18,a year ago,1 star,"They are always closed ...and no sweet tea after 10pm....and they always say due to maintenance issues....if your having problems just close up.
I won't be back."
12532,18,2 years ago,5 stars,"The line was very long yet took maybe 5 minutes to get through.  Food was fresh, hot & made to order."
12533,18,a year ago,3 stars,"Fast service, but inefficient.  Forgot my boy's chocolate milk with his 6 piece happy meal."
12534,18,4 years ago,5 stars,Friendly and clean!  And you have to try the new quarter pounder if you havent already!  I used to always get the chicken sandwich because i didnt care for the burgers until i saw the new quarter pounder sign!
12535,18,7 years ago,1 star,"I went to McDonald's for only a drink, 3/30/16 @ 9:40 pm and the young guy at the drive thru was a TOTAL JERK. I wasn't even being mean or anything just wanted a drink. In a one minute conversation he was so rude!! I told him what an a** hole he was being and drove away. Another reason why I don't go to McDonald's at I10&Leon Spring!!!"
12536,18,2 years ago,5 stars,"I went there to dine in and use their free hotspot to look for jobs.The dine in is closed. I went thru their drive thru...the understood my order, gave it to me promptly and wore goles and facemakes during whole process."
12537,18,2 years ago,1 star,"Bad service i know we go in to this pandemic and it is rug times,we need to be aware that there is people traveling and one stop for food be more polite to costumers dont make us fill bad for our food we are working and try to help busyness dont be rude to us"
12538,18,5 months ago,3 stars,Pretty fast for a breakfast rush
12539,18,4 years ago,2 stars,"This is, hands down, the slowest McDonald's I have ever been to.  I'm not talking one or two times they e been slow -- every single time I come here.  Glaciers move faster than this service."
12540,18,a year ago,5 stars,This is one of the fastest McDonald's in the area despite having only 1 drive through lane. Highly recommend
12541,18,a year ago,1 star,Just picked up my order of a basket of fries ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï
12542,18,3 years ago,3 stars,"Ate chicken nuggets which were surprisingly good. I""m picky about my nuggets. Fries sucked. Soggy and no salt on them. Threw them away. Honey mustard sauce was good."
12543,18,11 months ago,3 stars,"What can I say, it's McDonald's. Food was as expected, however everything cost a bit more then I'm used to from McDonald's."
12544,18,3 years ago,5 stars,"Order correct, coupon worked, courtesy and thoughtfulness! Convenient to my grandkids house. Yes! Did NOT eat in the car!"
12545,18,5 years ago,1 star,girl at cash register taking orders did not know how to do anything let alone help customers.. she said next  so I walk up to the register told her what i wanted and she walk off then helped a person that walk up to counter then walk back to the register and said next customer when I was standing right in front of her and never said sorry for at what can I get you.... somebody needs to train better

12552,18,5 years ago,1 star,Horrible drive thru service. 27 minutes and counting
12553,18,2 years ago,1 star,One hour in drive thru at night ridiculous they said they don't do curb side after 10pm ridiculous then don't make us wait an hour for an order of fries
12554,18,a year ago,3 stars,Keep getting screwed on my fries TWICE in a row they were half full and not that fresh.  The nuggets are nuggets.
12555,18,3 years ago,3 stars,Menu did not have all the sandwiches it displayed.. in addition  the menu need to remain static so that people  can clearly  make a informed choice
12556,18,2 years ago,4 stars,Usually pretty good occasionally they get backed up but all in all a solid location
12557,18,2 years ago,1 star,"$3 for a basket of fried that were dry, over cooked, and no salt.  What a waste.  Drive thru and on highway so cannot refund/exchange."
12558,18,3 years ago,1 star,Fake food never gets five stars. I'm always ashamed I took my kids to eat here. Great service not great food

12568,18,4 years ago,5 stars,This location is one of the best McDonald's I've eaten at. I worked there a long time ago and it's good to know it's still being run well enough.
12569,18,4 years ago,1 star,"Worst mcdonalds I have ever been too, waited in line AFTER I ordered for 10 minutes to finally get to the food pickup window  once I finally got there I was asked to pull forward ""cause my food was ready but the frys needed 2 more minutes"" five minutes later i go inside and finally get my meal, that is stone cold."

12582,18,3 years ago,2 stars,I'm visiting from Florida and this is the second time try the drive thru and it has been extremely slow. Only for an after school treat.
12583,18,4 years ago,4 stars,It's McDonald's. Service was fast and friendly. Can't give it 5 stars because it's McDonald's and unless staff is rude or the place is dirty it's hard to mess up McDonald's
12584,18,3 years ago,4 stars,Good McDonald's. Usually get the orders right. Bigger orders just need to check they don't forget anything and of they did they fix it right away.
12585,18,5 years ago,1 star,Ridiculous wait time.  Waited for 18 minutes in line and still no one was moving.  We just drove off.  This is the slowest McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï

Out. Staff seemed confused as my order sat on the counter with workers waking past it many times before they finally gave it to me."
12978,18,4 years ago,1 star,"Pure trash. Worst experience on multiple occasions. Card swiped and charged twice. Took and act of Congress to get it reversed. Paid at the first window, drove to the second window, and employee says, ""You didn't pay for your food!"" Show the receipt and no apology or remorse, just ""oh?!"" Hands food to me. Last episode, shortchanged $20 of a $100 Bill. GM says next, we checked everything except what was actually take from the register and denies error in the transaction, but say I'll give you a free meal and dessert?! I can't wait to see that location shut down for good. Shame on the franchise owner and the corporation for the service at that location. Filing a police report and BBB complaint."

12980,4,3 weeks ago,1 star,"Just to preface, I'm not a McDonald's regular so I don't know what the norm is for this location.
I placed a mobile order, and when I came to pick up it disappeared into the backroom chaos.  About 10 minutes go by and there were people overflowing the drivethrough and the indoor registers.  I figured I'd just hang out and just check in every once in a while, since I had nothing pressing to do.
Dozens of orders went through while I was there.  Most of them went through slowly, and a LOT needed substitutions since many products weren't available.  The store's CO2 went down, so they couldn't give out soda.  Bottled drinks were being subbed for soda, shakes being subbed for ice cream, lemonades being subbed for tea.  They were trying with what they had, but what an absolute madhouse...  Listening to the regulars in line, it sounds like this has been common recently.

This exercise of curiosity went on so long (~an hour) that there seemed to be a shift change.  Two of the new employees got together and figured out my mobile order.  Apparently, mobiles don't process automatically and need some kind of manual start by an employee - which didn't happen the previous times I asked.  Because of this, I'm sure that this doesn't reflect in their service metrics at all.

The employee that was able to help me asked first for my order number.  The number she was looking for was supposed to be something like '756' or '1691', like you see on your paper receipts.
However, that number is not actually sent to you via the app nor by email.  That sounds like an oversight with mobile ordering, rather than the local store.
After they figured it out, it took maybe 30 seconds to get my food.  Super weird experience."
12981,4,a month ago,3 stars,"Normally a 1 score across the board but this last visit was definitely a 5. I assume because there was a manager or rep from the corporate or home offices working. This visit was like I remember from years ago. Hot food, pleasant employees, both order screens taking orders, and it wasn't even a long a** line for the driver thru. Even the intrusive pesky  panhandlers were gone."
12982,4,2 weeks ago,3 stars,"The service is lousy. You will sit in the drive thru 10-15 minutes before even placing your order to get a large sweet tea, and then you will wait another 10-15 minutes to get it.  I hate that there's not another one close. If you want to wait, this is the place."
12983,4,2 days ago,1 star,"Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded."

Please Oak Park government, make panhandling illegal again; most people who do this get in other people's faces and harass them and verbally abuse them. God forbid one of these people pulls a knife or gun on a customer if they say no.

13020,4,a year ago,1 star,"Please avoid this location at all costs.Not all the employees are wearing masks & gloves, not even hairnets. While in line at the drive through I watched as they handed bags to cars, the drivers checked them out & gave it back, wrong order. Then it happened again, & I was able to see the staff member put the she retrieved from previous customer to the side. When I got to the window for my pickup, she wanted me to take that bag. When I said no, & ask to get the order redone, she wanted to debate this issue, I finally asked for a refund. When food goes out of their possession and comes back from a customer, itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s spoiled & should be thrown out, industry standards, especially in todayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s environment.

13022,4,a year ago,3 stars,Sometimes the service is good sometimes the service is bad. Sometimes you'll get your correct food sometimes you don't get the correct food you ordered. But one thing is for certain they get their money EVERYTIME. I'm tired of the some timing so I will not come back.
13023,4,a year ago,3 stars,Fast food movesca bit slow. Which would be fine if my fries and sandwich were hot and got my order correct. Disappointed I had no pickles on my chicken sandwich which was not even warm and fries cold and waxy! Very disappointed.  Busy can become unbusy.

The food is not what it use to be...the fries tasty liked they were cooked in old cooking oil. They were cold as well. I was very disappointed with this meal.

13030,4,2 years ago,3 stars,"Be ready to wait!!  It's a McDonald's so you know what to expect in regards to the good. The problem at this location is the speed of service, since about April. In April they changed to drive thru only and have since added carry for those willing to walk in.  Both the drive thru and in person wait are constantly long. Most recently I went there for a Big Mac meal and it took 5 minutes before I could place my order with only 2 people ahead of me and then waited 7-9 minutes for my order to be done. I did see 2 people that ordered after me, get their orders first, and neither was a smaller order."

I've been here twice so far. Each time the people working the counter were organized, quick & cheerful. Truly a treat when you get your order taken this way, twice. I'll be going here monthly & hopefully the staff stays this way. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"

The Dr. Pepper tasted water down, fries was not filled to the top and the 6 piece happy meal is extra and not included if you use the buy the combo get happy meal free coupon. Even though it's included in the options when ordering on the mobile app. Doesn't make much sense to me....."

One time they gave me two sausage bagels. The next time they gave me two sausage bagels with egg and cheese. The third time they gave me two steak and cheese bagels with egg. When I tried to call the number on the receipt, it goes to some corporate number who never returned my call."

13039,4,3 years ago,2 stars,This used to be the best location for the freshest food but it clearly is not anymore. My nuggets were over done and I had to pour my drink out twice because it either tasted like pure syrup or water and I had to settle for something I didn't want to drink. Also how do you ask the customer what kind of sauce they want and STILL don't put it in the bag and got the nerve to catch an attitude when I ask you for it. I won't be going back to this location.
13040,4,a year ago,5 stars,"Use the app for deals. This location is clean, and orderly. Service is polite and orders are accurate. What more would you ask for? A happy meal? They have those too."
13041,4,a year ago,3 stars,"Sorry! The previous review for this McDonald's was actually for Al's Grill . This McDonald's is on Madison across from the Oak Park Police Station. It is very popular and the drive through is always busy and packed.it is only a couple blocks from Chicago far west Austin neighborhood,  but in Oak Park, a relatively safe and attractive suburb.  The fast food is like the other McDonald's,  good to you, but not necessarily good for you,  LOL. Prices are good too."
13042,4,a week ago,5 stars,Great food and service
13043,4,2 years ago,4 stars,"Long lines but that's McDonald's for you, when they are selling crack I mean two all beef patties with special sauce on a sesame seed bun. The problems lies when you have a big order at the drive through. You must hold the line to make sure you got everything you ordered because you dont want to have to go inside or go through the drive through again. Quite a dilemma."
13044,4,2 years ago,4 stars,Ordered my food. Just your typical McDonald's.  The special orders were all correct. Slight wait and the manager gave me two free holiday pie desserts for the hassle. Excellent customer recovery and service.

I always get our food wrong every time no matter what.

What ever. I like eating here it's cozy. Has a fire place and over all nice. Employees are your average 21st century customer service type, horrible."
13050,4,2 years ago,5 stars,I so missed this place since it was not serving breakfast during the early onset of the COVID-19 Virus.  Could not wait to grab me two sausage biscuit sandwiches yesterday when I stopped in and due to not having one since March 2020.  Still great sandwich and fast place to eat for a quick bite.
13051,4,5 years ago,2 stars,"Went through the drive through and had poor customer service. It was late at night (10pm) though, so I understand. Also the wait was 15+ minutes for my order while others were churning through. Lesson learned: chicken tenders take time."

This time, I ordered the same thing, but this time it's a sweetened tea. I mean, the short time I worked there, I was in the drive through window taking orders since I was the most efficient there out of everyone and had the most enthusiasm. These last 2 trips have been misfires compared to past trips. Note that I go through the drive through after 11pm when it's not busy at all, so there's no reason to mess up an order with 2 items or less."

I normally go through the drive-thru at 5:30 in the morning, along with numerous of other cars, and there's never a long wait. I'm normally in and out the Drive-Thru,  ( With my food and beverage ) in about 10 to 15 minutes tops!! My coffee, cheese, biscuit, egg and steak seemingly, is always waiting for me good, and hot every morning. In-fact everything that, I've ever purchase from here, has always been good. ""Oh! And I must say that the employees even at, 4:30 in the morning, are always pleasant, polite,, and friendly. And that really helps me, jump start my day!

I got a fish fillet and had to throw it in the garbage. I got a biscuit sandwich earlier and the bread was too hard. I had to throw it out. Don't get me started on the hash browns. Check your food before leaving to see if it's edible. You give them good money and they give you good garbage."

I purchased my meals via the McDonald's app in order to save some time when I arrived and pulled into curbside parking slot #4 and entered it into the app I received the message that this store is currently closed, which it was not! So I had to wait in the drive thru lane almost 15 minutes only to have the cashier charge my account twice, then had to wait roughly another 10 minutes for the manager to appear only to tell me there is nothing she can do about it and I would have to contact the app department."

13072,4,3 years ago,1 star,"Teach your employees basic math. I'm relying on delivery services because of the COVID outbreak closing everything. Unfortunately that means I'm stuck with what I get. I ordered 3 hashbrowns, and received 1. Did you know, that 3 means there are 2 more hash browns than 1? Amazing fact, isn't it? It's something you should've learned in pre school. On top of that, they gave me no receipt. I have no proof of this. Maybe it's in your computer, but I demand a refund since I can't get one with the delivery app, and maybe pick up the phone as I was calling this McDonald's about this over and over. Thank you."

13074,4,5 years ago,2 stars,It's not what it used to be. There longer waits in line and the service isn't really all that great. They're sometimes understaffed because that people are overworked or not paid enough. However it does serve the local community and passerbuys. So it is good for something.

13144,4,6 years ago,4 stars,"Most have no idea the historic significance of this McDonalds.  Back in the 60's ALL McDonalds restaurants were drive-ins....meaning no indoor seating.  You ate in your car (or standing outside).  Oak Park had an ordinance that stated ""no drive-in restaurants"" but Ray Kroc (founder of McDonalds wanted a McDonalds in his home town).  So in order to get approval to be built, THIS very McDonalds,  agreed to install stand up (hi-top) tables inside so technically you could eat inside.  It was to my knowledge the first McDonalds ever where you could sit inside and eat.  As I recall, it opened in/around 1966 or so.  It was a VERY big deal around the area."

13634,4,3 days ago,1 star,"Good morning, Please tell me if this matters or if I'm being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned. Maybe because I didn't have my coffee this morning.

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded."

13655,36,9 months ago,1 star,"We waited 20 minutes for our mobile order till we went up to a worker and told her we had a mobile order. She walked away without even saying anything and came right back out with our food which was probably just sitting aside the whole time. The fries are old I even took a picture to show. I understand dine in is closed but at least be consistent with your mobile orders and kindness goes a long way, she needs more training."
13656,36,a month ago,1 star,"I repeated my order numerous time and he repeated. Get to the window and review the order and it was wrong. The employee was debating the order and ask to speak to a manager. And to my findings it was another employee that did the same debate. I ask numerous time if he was supervisor or manager and he said yes. False. Ask for corporate number and dumv found. Was asked to pull forward and they wound bring out my order. Four cars passed and I walked onto the store and a white female dressed in store uniform appeared after a wait period to give me the order. In the car, open order. Fries old and burger burnt. Just sad. The order was trashed."
13657,36,3 months ago,1 star,"10+ cars in line, no one taking orders, went to the first window and she said she couldn't take my order to go to the next, the next window had a huge attitude and got smart with me saying she can't take my order either and don't know why the first window told me that. So I asked where I should order and she said ""not here"" and when I asked her again she said to come in the lobby. So I drive around and tried but the doors were locked so I went back to the window again and she took my order, and then I get home to find the crispy chicken sandwich I ordered is just bread, pickles, and sauce. No chicken. Don't even want to waste my time going back. Last time I ordered it I got a spicy mcchicken which is also wrong. Learn the menu, care about your customers. I will not be returning to this location."
13658,36,3 months ago,5 stars,"This is the best McDonald's I have been to in a long time!   I have 1 across the street from my apartment and I wish I could swap them out.  Service at THIS McDonald's is excellent and everyone that I interacted with was friendly and helpful.  The food actually looked like the advertising and tasted good.  I was so impressed that I asked for the manager so I could thank him and compliment his crew.  I truly believe that managers affect everything about their restaurant,  for  good or bad. Happy, respected employees who feel properly valued always reflect that in their interactions with customers and you could see that this manager was a leader of a team and not just the boss! Great McDonald's experience!"
13659,36,2 weeks ago,5 stars,"I would usually not rave about McDonald's as we eat there multiple times a week, but the service at this location was head and shoulders above the norm. Elizabeth, the floor supervisor, was amazing. She customized our burgers and figure out the best combos to feed the family. She made sure we had everything we needed and introduced us to strawberry pie.  Highly recommend this location."
13660,36,2 weeks ago,1 star,"I order my food ahead of time online. Only to get there 25 minutes later and it's not even ready. The large fry I ordered was 3/4 of the way full, there was absolutely no ice in my drink, which was a lemonade and tea so it's not like it was cold like the sodas come out of the machine. and they were practically shoving me out the door when I asked for ketchup and salt. By far one of the worst customer service experiences I've had"

They have very busy times, which is in part due to their location on the highway in a restaurant area, but also because they are a solid restaurant.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Their curbside service gives you an estimate of your wait, which is appreciated, and your food will be delivered by a friendly employee (an improvement from my previous experience). My only complaint is that it's obvious they make your curbside drink far earlier than your delivery, because they come to you partially melted (see the slush below).

13663,36,3 months ago,1 star,"There's a reason why there's mainly 5 stars and one star reviews for this McDonald's. I will say about 50% of the time it's good and then the other half is horrible. One time I went before breakfast ended. And place my order. Got to the first window to pay for the order and then when I got to the window to pick up my order they told me they couldn't do breakfast anymore. Another time I went inside around 7pm and despite the door being open and plenty of employees chatting and talking instead of working, they said they were drive-thru only currently. Another time the line wasn't that long but took a good 20 minutes to get through and when I got to the window to pick up my order they had more employees inside talking and chatting. There's been a few times some lady taking the order wasn't friendly and kept rushing orders by asking ""anything else?""  I will say though that the food has almost always been hot and correctly ordered, that is the only good thing about this location."
13664,36,2 months ago,1 star,"After decades of serving families, McDonald's is on their way out. I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs. McDonald's needs individuals who can read, comprehend and speak English. Today I went there for lunch. I ordered #6 Filet-o-Fish sandwich meal. I ended up with 10 peice chicken nuggets. Hmmmm....I  guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said Filet-o-Fish sandwich. I quickly caught the error and told the cashier. She said, ""So you don't want it?"" Then, the manager came along to find out what the problem was. I  explained and received the sandwich. I left and when I  got home, I found out I  had a frosted breakfast pastry in a ,Filet-o-Fish box! Come on now McD's. May we get better service and expect a lot more from you? If not, please close your doors to save the public from the irritation."

13666,36,a month ago,1 star,Drove up to lane 1 to place order. Waited to be acknowledged. 2 vehicles drove up to lane 2 while I continued to wait and placed their orders before me. I pulled ahead to the window never being acknowledged at drive thru speaker. When I pulled to the window I stated that I was never acknowledged and didn't get to place my order. I was told that I could not place an order at the window and to go back through the drive thru. I chose to go to another location. I submitted a formal complaint about their policy through their app. Be prepared for drive thru customer service inconsistency if you go to this location.
13667,36,a month ago,1 star,Second time I've been to this location and the second time was even worse than the first. The fries were so soggy the box was getting flimsy from the excess oil. I couldn't even eat them. The cashier was complaining about having to refund me my milkshake (because apparently they didn't have milkshakes). My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich and the chicken was visibly burnt.

13669,36,a week ago,1 star,This was by far the worst experience I've had a McDonalds drive through.  There were only a few cars in line but I waited 30 minutes to get to the order station and another 15 to get to the window to pay and get my food.  I can't imagine what they were doing in there that it took so long.
13670,36,2 months ago,1 star,"Consistently the SLOOOWEST McDonalds I have ever seen. Also their prices are higher than all of the other McDonalds in Austin for some reason. To top it off, the food is usually cold and they have a hard time even understanding your orderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"
13671,36,4 days ago,1 star,"What can I say, it's McDonalds.  The food is never cold or smashed. It's hit or miss on the type of employee you'll get at the drive through. They either ""don't want to be here and hate the fact that you're making them work"" or they ""smile and make you feel welcomed"". It's close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch.

I'm editing my last post and changing my rating. I waited in the Drive-Thru for 10 minutes with no one coming on the line. The other line however three cars went through while I sat there. I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around. The level of unacceptable is insane.  I try to be understanding of fast food workers because I know they deal with ugly people but this takes the cake.  The day is Monday June 11th 2023 at 345pm. The morning crew is a good bunch of workers, however the afternoon crew has always been extremely slow."

The cashier said she didn't have a order for my code I was giving her. She went over to the drive thru cashier and she told him he needs to process the mobile orders in the drive thru. It was causing a delay with several customers"

I said yes and told her what I would like and it was never brought out to me. I ate what I ordered and they never brought it. I had to go to work so I just had to leave.
13676,36,3 months ago,1 star,Absolutely terrible experience! Walked in and ordered our food on the kiosk.

My daughter's cup was leaking as it was broken and I had to get a new one even though they had given it to us with it filled and had to have known it was like that. Most of the workers were just standing around. Even though it was lunch time they could not take a 100.00 and there was not signs up. Thank goodness I had another form of payment.

Overall was just not the best McDonald's I have been at."
13678,36,5 months ago,1 star,If I can give this place ZERO stars I would! I went through drive through and cashier informed me to wait on line 1. So I drove and parked while I was waiting a lot of vehicles passed through. There was an older lady with red hair giving out deliveries of food so I was wondering when my order was going to come out waiting there for 30minutes or Longer. So I walked inside asking for my order and come to find out that my order was given to someone else! So they had to put my order again through the system so I can get my food so again Now I had to wait for others to come out before mine because my order was last in line. Food wasn't warm once I got it and fries had salt when I ordered no salt. Never coming to this place again if your near by this location I recommend going to the McDonald's on 183 by Taco Bell.

I got there at 6:45am and opening time is listed as 5am. I was waiting at the drive through speaker for 10 minutes, NOBODY even said anything. I drive up to the order window and see another car that was there ever since I got here, parked, waiting for food for forever. The payment window was empty. I parked and decided to order inside but the door was locked, even though they were OPEN! the 2 employees inside were just standing there doing nothing, they saw me knock and purposefully completely ignored me.
Maybe they are understaffed but not an excuse to be so disrespectful to a knocking customer and NOT even put up some kind of sign or open the door to a knocking customer to let them know whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s going on!

Trying to make things easier, I asked if the inside was open and I was shouted with a ""yes"". I reversed and parked into one of the empty parking spots. Then me and my 4 other guests walked inside. Took a tremendous amount of time for either one of the employees (Both pictured) to come and assist us as they were just laughing and talking amongst themselves. I was first to order and I was treated with ""I told you there was only breakfast, whomever it was that went through drive through."" I was disgusted with the horrendous treatment I received by the manager (Pictured in white). I'm sorry you hate your job, but that is no way to treat a customer. I was very polite, even though I was very upset about the service. The manager (Pictured in white should be fired) was so rude and acted as if he hated his job. The other employee (Pictured) was very rude as well as she tossed our food into the bag and threw it onto the counter for us to pickup. I was very upset at the horrible service we received. I don't know if it had anything to do with our race, but I did not want to go that route. Corporate please, read this and fire these two employees as they are harming your business  HORRIBLE SERVICE!

The staff as a whole are lazy and not at all interested in customer or service. French fries taste like they were cooked hours before being served fountain drinks taste like bath water only slightly warmer. Hours are mis-posted on the entrance door and for serving product that is already cooked and just sitting under the heat lamp they are in a league of their own when it comes to the slowness of their service. I will gladly drive twenty miles out of my way to avoid this location in the future."

I placed an online mobile order, showed up 5 minutes later, and the lady kept me waiting for minutes until she told me they didnt have my order.

Then after I got my receipt and proceeded to next window, I  looked at the receipt , and I was upcharged $.39 for the water. What the heck? So I asked the employee at the window, wht was I uocharged .39 cents for the water. She said "" I don't know, that's all we got"". I  understand that the soda machines are down, but to offer can drinks and water, but uocharge, and not told why, or an employee to make the effort to explain, or even care.

13762,36,3 years ago,3 stars,This place really depends on who is working sometimes there on there A game other times you have to deal with the BS and get a manager. My worse experience here was handed a 20 bill to the cashier my total owed was just about 5 bucks they gave me two 5's back and said have a nice day I caught this on the fly by luck and said you still owe me a 5 and some change the cashier said no you gave me 15 dollars I said no they don't make a 15 dollar bill long story short had to have them count the whole register down with the manager there just to get my correct change back.
13763,36,4 years ago,2 stars,This is one of the worst McD's around. I've only been there twice in maybe a year but both experiences were far less than stellar. For starters the smell coming thru the window was awful. On today's visit  apparently the person in front of me claimed my order and the cashier didn't handle it well. She kept yelling to the front that the lady paid for the wrong order ($3 less- like she didn't notice) and it took her about 5 min to straighten it all out. Skip this one and move on to the next one down the road.
13764,36,4 years ago,1 star,"Hated my experience going inside, the cashier was flustered and kept messing up, I paid for a large drink but she hands me a medium cup, they were out of ice on both drink fountains and when the manager was told she already knew.  Then someone said we're not out, they're both broken.  So where's the sign letting the customers know?  And out of all that my fries had no salt on them, now y'all know that's the best part of your trip to Mickey Dee's, eating the hot fries... smh!!!!"

Edit: I forgot to mention they have those kiosks to order yourself which severely reduces waiting time. An employee was even willing to show me how to use the darn thing. I refused, of course.

They made us pay for an order of fries that should have already been included in our order. It took us so long to get through that drive thru and the entire situation was a complete mess. Smh."
13769,36,3 years ago,1 star,"We are staying at the hotel next door. My husband checks online to make sure the restaurant and dining room are open. They are. He walks over and the doors are locked. Walks back to the hotel, takes his car through the drive through, sits for 10 minutes and receives no service although there were employees in the restaurant. He sees other cars trying to receive service but they are all being ignored. He comes back to the hotel and calls again, at least 6 times, each time it says the number is disconnected even though he had already confirmed they were open through the same number earlier. Finally someone answers the call, he asks if they are open and they said no, he asked them why they answered the phone and were in the restaurant at 1am if it is closed, they said because their job is just to answer the phone. Its clear that the employees wanted to get paid for working all night without serving any customers. My husband used to work in fast food, and I wanted to believe that the stereotypes of McDonalds employees being terrible people and workers to not be true, but this location makes the company look bad. McDonald's should fire the franchise owner, or shut this location down, because they clearly dont know how to hire dependable employees."
13770,36,3 years ago,1 star,"Even If you get there first in the drive thru (everyday, only a limited places to eat with my time), maybe 3 to 5 people behind you, order a simple #1 meal you get pushed to the pick up meal area with the same 3 to 5+ waiting for our food. Just and sometimes the people behind you get their food first and they ordered more than you! And by the time I get my food the fries are stale and super salty!
It seems like they are trying to out clear their drive thru numbers to show corporate they are clearing numbers."
13771,36,5 years ago,1 star,"The manager and or the Owner does not have business sense. Poor staffing for the late shift. I pulled up to order some french fries at 10:30 and was told it will be a 20 minute wait and to pull to the parking lot. I asked why and the person said ""I have to go to school in the morning"". He said the owner do the hiring and it is not his fault. 1. Bad choice of words. 2. They may need to not be a 24 hour McDonald's 3. Hire appropriate staff.
I was taken back be the unprofessionalism I was handed. And charged $2 for a small order of fries.  SMH. I am glad that my mood was good. However I do not feel sorry for reporting them to the BBB and giving a BAD rating. They need to do better or get better ownership because they McDonald's look bad."

But ive been to this McDonald's 5 times and this was my best experience yet.

13774,36,2 years ago,1 star,I've been to this location a few times and everytime I have been the food is always old and the fries taste like they have been sitting for hours. They are always out of sweet tea and coffee and it seems like nobody cares about the quality of food that is being served.

13776,36,3 years ago,1 star,The customer service is very very bad. I waited there for almost 25 minutes to be served. That's not the first time. I was there like that. So I walked out and I went to the drive-thru. I was in the drive through and out of the drive-thru probably in about 3 minutes. That is the worst manager I have ever seen
13777,36,4 years ago,1 star,"Do you want dysentery, cholera, or one of the ""Big-5""? Then eat here, otherwise you would be wise to avoid this McDonalds as if it were the plague. Immediately upon walking through the door I was stunned by an extremely offensive and pungent odor. It was so difficult to focus on much else due to the severity of the smell. This was not a smell of hamburgers or French fries, this was the smell of spilled milk that had soured and marred in the 100+ Texas heat for weeks. Truly, this smell is likely from the repeated spilling of soda at the drink stations that had either been overlooked or merely disregarded by careless employees. Beyond the smell, the sights were just as appalling. There were trays with discarded food and wrappers lining the tables as well as smashed food around the floor. Granted the trays are the result of lazy and inconsiderate people that believe they shouldn't be required to tend to their mess; the employee's should have direction from management to conduct a lobby check at set periods to ensure this doesn't result in customer  dissatisfaction. All this being said, I simply walked into the lobby to order a drink and I would have been on my merry way. I stood at the counter and waited for one of the cashiers to acknowledge that they were ready to take my order. I received numerous glances from, who I assumed was, the front of store worker. I was the only customer in line in the lobby, but understood that there was also a drive through at which customers were present. I waited a bit longer, received additional glances from previously said employees. Still, I was not asked for my order. I was doing nothing that would have given the appearance that I was unready to order. I was not on the phone, not fiddling with my wallet; I was standing quietly, intently looking at multiple employees that dismissed my presence. 4 employees present, 2 managers in the back and zero orders from me. This normally would not have been an issue, I would have waited a bit longer, but the lack of regard for cleanliness and the piercing stench that wafted throughout the lobby forced me to leave. I'm not likely to enter this facility nor purchase any product from this store after today. If the management and workers leave the front of the store in such a state, it forces me to wonder about the areas where customers cannot see. To all those that dare enter, 'ye be warned'."

What a sweetheart, she was all smiles and just a joy for my first stranger encounter of the day. With the way things have been going in this country the last several months, she was a bright spot in an otherwise dreary daily grind, and I will not soon forget how she lifted my spirits all over a sausage burrito and a cup of coffee. She set the bar, good job."

This is like 300IQ so get ready. You get a piece of paper and write something to the effect of ""drive thru closed"" and tape it to the drive thru speakerbox.

They took down a quarter pounder with cheese meal because that's likely more common than what I ordered. And instead of admitting they may have messed up, she told me I was wrong and needed to just accept that. I have been told that they only carry 2 types of sauce for nuggets as well, which I believe isnt true. I believe they just didnt know the other ones and didnt want to find out. I have also had large fries consistently only filled about 3/4's of the way. Never once have I had a full large fries from there."
13810,36,3 years ago,1 star,"Breafast burritos tortillas are always hard and eggs are dried out when I go late in the morning.  So I ask for extra cheese. Cashier says they cannot do that because they are already made. I tell her make me 2 fresh ones. She says she has to ""go see""  Comes back and says no.  I order something elsr and aak for fries. It is only 10:15 and we cant make fries until 10:30.  I can get hash browns at 3:00 pm but cant get fries until after 10:30?? Makes no sense. I ask for manager. She says ""I am the manager""  Really? Then why did you have to go ask about the cheese?  Do you always ASK your emoyees if tthey can put cheese on sonething?  So now she not only gives bad service...but LIES to me about being manager!  I want call from OWNER"
13811,36,4 years ago,1 star,"Everytime I go here they seem to have an issue with charging for ranch. Today a told them at the speaker box twice I wanted a total of 3 ranch. Which honestly, I could use five or six. When I got to the second window I only found one. It was a manger serving me. I explained to her that I asked for a total of 3 ranches. She hands me 1 and proceeds to tell me I was not charged for it. Annoyed I grab the change and explained to her I ask for extra everytime and it ends up like this. At this point the manager quickly grabbed 2 more and rushed me off. I understand I was not charge, I am willing to pay the extra dollar or 2 for extra. Please dont be rude to me cause I like enough sauce for my nuggets."
13812,36,4 years ago,1 star,"The place sucked. The manager forced us to used the ""self order kiosk"" which I hate using. If I have to take my own order, give me an employee discount. Then a girl behind the counter told me their coffee machine was down then offered me a cup of regular coffee I'm place of the ""McCafe"" I ordered for $4. Then I ordered 2 apple pies and found cherry pies in the apple pie box. I was the told they only had 1 apple pie left. Instead of offering a refund, I was asked ""if"" I wanted one. I was given the incorrect amount back for my refund.  It was the worst ""Mcspirience"". I ever had."
13813,36,5 years ago,1 star,"Was told to wait on the side of the building which is typical when long lines form in the drive thru. These guys didn't have the courtesy to bring me my food. I had to wait outside in the heat for 15 minutes before I got fed up to go inside and have one of them say ""It's been ready"".  Worst customer service I've ever received at ANY McDonalds. Way to be terrible!"

13816,36,4 years ago,4 stars,"They have a great deal on drinks and since I don't eat meat, the main reason I ever drive through is to get a drink and sometimes, an ice cream cone. This time, the ice cream machine was broken. It seems to happen with some frequency. I guess they serve lots of shakes and ice cream."
13817,36,3 years ago,4 stars,"It was great I had a birthday party there for a sibling. The staff was really nice, they gave us some extra happy meals because they messed up our cake we are the great time we had cookies and had a bunch of fun I'd recommend coming here it was niceï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"
13818,36,5 years ago,1 star,I guess my expectations should be low. Inside smelled like $#!T somehow. Management and staff were having loud personal conversations that included cuss words. Talking about how they were so ready to go home cant deal with this bs. Among other things. One manager was on her phone while tending to fries. Cashier was soft spoken and rude or clueless. Gnats flew around my food as I ate. I was given my ice by the cashier from a bucket behind the register. There were no ketchup or napkins out for self serve so when I asked for them they were thrown on my tray. It is McDongles after all.

Always during lunch it gets packed and they have a way to order your food yourself now me being me I would help out bit when it's always asked in a rude way to order your meal back there I cannot accept. They need more help there obviously.. Sorry McDonalds but needs to change there tactics on time management and other stuff aside from that a gentleman behind me did not get to order because he didnt place his order by himself but neither did i.. No bueno.

Disappointed with morning staff or at least this lady individually."
13823,36,4 years ago,1 star,this is the absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced. I was at the drive-thru for at least 3 minutes and nobody ever responded on the intercom box and then when I pulled up to the window the lady said it was working that they just didn't take my order

13826,36,5 years ago,1 star,"Terrible  customer service. Besides having to wait in line at the drive -thru for over 10 mins to get 1 coffee, was pathetic. Then it never fails the employee at the window that hands your food thru drive thru, never is even courteous or says a simple HELLO or Here', your food! I hate service like that. And it hasn't just been this one time, it's always that way."
13827,36,3 years ago,1 star,"I been looking forward to visiting a high tech Macdonald and to my surprised was the dirtiest Macdonalds I been in. Bathrooms were filthy and the main dinning area needs a thorough cleanup. Seen third world countries Macdonald and always been spotless.

I would not record this location, I mentioned it to an employee and she mumble as she walk away."
13828,36,6 years ago,1 star,"Talk about HORRIBLE SERVICE this is by far the worse place to try to go at any time of the day, you have nothing but RUDE EMPLOYEES. Definitely a lesson learned I have had quite a few BAD EXPERIENCES going to this mcdonals. NEVER AGAIN! I rather drive an extra 10-15 minutes and take my money and my business somewhere else.

I AM HIGHLY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS PLACE!"
13829,36,6 years ago,1 star,"Usually I don't have time to eat at McDonalds. So I take food to-go. This is not the first time that I order something and I get something. These people always miss something from the order and since its to-go, I can't even go back and tell them. It happened like 5-6th so far. Very poor service from this McD.

Hopefully they read this and do something about it."

13832,36,7 years ago,5 stars,"The last person just said this place is outdated and mentioned that there are iPads on the tabe... For some reason that doesn't make sense to me. I just went there and ordered some food. The manager who took my order joked around with me making me laugh. That's always a plus. After I payed I decided that I wanted an ice cream cone. The manager dude that took my order just gave me the ice cream cone on the house! The food I ordered was delicious too. Thanks yall, I'll be back for sure now."
13833,36,5 years ago,1 star,Probably the worst McDondalds I have visited on a regular basis in my life. Rude employees that don't care and something is ALWAYS wrong with my order.  And for some reason the debit card reader is always down.

14433,36,3 months ago,1 star,"After decades of serving families, McDonald's is on their way out. I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs. McDonald's needs individuals who can read, comprehend and speak English. Today I went there for lunch. I ordered #6 Filet-o-Fish sandwich meal. I ended up with 10 peice chicken nuggets. Hmmmm....I  guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said Filet-o-Fish sandwich. I quickly caught the error and told the cashier. She said, ""So you don't want it?"" Then, the manager came along to find out what the problem was. I  explained and received the sandwich. I left and when I  got home, I found out I  had a frosted breakfast pastry in a ,Filet-o-Fish box! Come on now McD's. May we get better service and expect a lot more from you? If not, please close your doors to save the public from the irritation."
14434,36,5 days ago,1 star,"What can I say, it's McDonalds.  The food is never cold or smashed. It's hit or miss on the type of employee you'll get at the drive through. They either ""don't want to be here and hate the fact that you're making them work"" or they ""smile and make you feel welcomed"". It's close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch.

I'm editing my last post and changing my rating. I waited in the Drive-Thru for 10 minutes with no one coming on the line. The other line however three cars went through while I sat there. I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around. The level of unacceptable is insane.  I try to be understanding of fast food workers because I know they deal with ugly people but this takes the cake.  The day is Monday June 11th 2023 at 345pm. The morning crew is a good bunch of workers, however the afternoon crew has always been extremely slow."

14456,2,11 months ago,1 star,"My order is WRONG every time; the most frustrating customer experience. I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel, and I've concluded that this location is a 120% mess. If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases. I ask for no cheese every time, and guess what is in my order.. CHEESE. Or my frys are half full, or the hashbrowns are completely missing, no syrup/ utensils are in the bag as requested. On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order, an employee brings out an incorrect order.. yes 3 times. Today this ""New"" team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it... what the hell? Every other time I let the incorrect order slide, but today I decided to speak with the store manager. I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders, and she replies ""Sorry"", I then ask ""what is mcdonalds doing about this, its every time the order is wrong?"" She responds ""I'm so sorry""... I ask again and same response.  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago, they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it.... this new location is a joke, its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this, and its been a few months since their brand new building opened."

This IS a McDonald's- not your family BBQ."
14481,2,9 months ago,5 stars,"This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to. They were closed for several months due to construction. The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational. The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft. The best thing about McDonald's are the FRIES!!!!  Their fries are always fresh, hot, and delicious. The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures. I don't mind waiting in the sometimes long drive-thru line for fresh food. Thank you for having pride in the food you serve."
14482,2,8 months ago,1 star,"Very disappointing after they rebuilt the whole building.  It is supposed to be the most modern of Equipment and yet it was the slowest experience I have ever had at a McDonald's, and only for two egg McMuffins.  Then, the English muffin was burnt on both sandwiches.  The staff definitely did not want to be there.  It is my closest McDonald's but I will definitely be driving the longer distance next time.  Just avoid this spot no matter what."

14503,2,11 months ago,2 stars,"My experience was ok. They forgot little things in my order, like a straw for iced tea, and cream and sugar that i requested.  The wifi is not available like they stated, when searching for wifi there is no ""mcdonals wifi"" instead it was a wired name like EBOS. The connection did not allow for simple web browsing.  For a Mcdonalds thats near universal studios. This place is ok."

Yes there are lines but the staff is fast and proficient and I always ask for my meals to be made fresh, although it isn't always necessary. Because of their popularity it always fresh and hot. A good place to stop or pickup a good and hot, fast meal."
14516,2,7 months ago,3 stars,Not truly 24 hours. Have been multiple times between the hours of 12am-4am and have been denied service either due to not serving food or not processing payments. Daytime operation is fine.

14530,2,11 months ago,1 star,"They always seem to forget something
in my delivery order,  napkins, straws, a whole order of fries. Pay attention , people. Okay this time you forgot a whole hamburger.  I ordered a Big Mac , it's on the delivery receipt , but it's nowhere to be found.  Furthermore, you sent a cookie that I didn't ask for in this order. What's that a consolation prize for losing the Big Mac."

14533,2,2 years ago,1 star,"It amazing how many items you can get wrong in one order. Fries were double salted yet undercooked. Soda wasn't what I asked for. Really just bad service from the drive thru, on multiple occasions.  This location does not properly represent the McDonald's brand."
14534,2,3 years ago,5 stars,"Paid a visit to see the unique architecture. Inside was small but very clean. They accepted my coupon and my order was brought to my table quickly. No complaints with my food, but it seemed like someone was having trouble with an Uber Eats order.

My cashier was scolded by the manger for being too cold or rude to some co-workers; he kept repeating ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½treat everyone like an equalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"

I always check my food right then and there because this location usually messes up drive though orders , and  when I showed them  the employee gave me a attitude and rolled their eyes at me . She even tried to say the fries fell out of the box into the bag . I showed her the bag being empty ,and even made the comment. Even no ketchup.  She then said I had to pull out of the drive through to wait for my order to be fixed it would be 5 to 10 minutes, since my lunch is only 30 minutes, I had no choice but to leave."

14544,2,2 years ago,1 star,"Just ordered two large drinks and two large fries. Both drinks taste wonky as if the syrup in the machines are off. And to top it all off, they had me pull to the side to wait on 2 (TWO) large fries.

Won't recommend this location to anyone looking for decent McDonald's food/drinks. Makes me glad I only ordered fries and drinks, I'd hate to see what else they'd wreck."
14545,2,a year ago,2 stars,"Used the app to order, but took 30 minutes to get it to me at the counter. That's way too long. Tons of people got served before I did and my order was placed well before the other customers showed up. The only thing going for this place is that it's 24Hours drive through. And dont use the app, relaying orders to individual stores may have some bugs.

Update: this place is torn down. The building razed and the lot surrounded by fencing. I guess the bums from the nearby overpass finally took its toll. Too bad cuz the 24 hour drive thru was pretty convenient."
14546,2,a year ago,5 stars,Newly renovated. Not a McDonald eater. Had some free time so I decided to have a cup of coffee with pie. Loved it.
14547,2,a year ago,1 star,This location should have stayed closed. Why do they have a re-opening sign when they're only operating for drive thru. What about the pedestrians? The ones who can't drive? At least I was able to walk in and  order food before they remodeled. I live less than a mile from here and I can't walk over and physically order food? And why is there a parking lot if we can't walk in. And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru? You're better off going to the one on burbank Blvd. Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesn't expect problems? This isn't it McDonald's... 20 minutes sitting in a drive thru...
14548,2,3 years ago,2 stars,Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked confused. The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too long. After 2 bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better food). I'm from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning wasn't an option.
14549,2,2 years ago,1 star,"I had quite possibly my worst McDonald's experience ever here. After ordering a sausage egg mcmuffin with a biscuit instead of English muffin, the order taker said

""ok I'll punch it in so it comes out a good deal for you.""

Um... Ok...

When I got the order it ONLY had egg. I politely informed the person at the drive through window, but they refused to correct the order, saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered I'd have to get back in line and place a new order!!

What the hell???

I won't be coming back here!"
14550,2,3 years ago,5 stars,"Good location. I went in as the drive thru line was a little long, must be a busy area. I got my food quick, I only had to wait a couple of minutes, I was not even able to fill up my drink cup before my food was done. The staff was quick and friendly."
14551,2,3 years ago,2 stars,"I'm not sure what's wrong with this location, but half the time I go there the food I get is old and cold. Today I went through the drive-thru and they had a rush, there were about 10 cars ahead of me. So I'm not sure how they can serve me cold food when they're constantly feeling orders. Just extremely disappointed with this location. I ordered a big Mac combo and the big Mac was cold and the fries were even colder"

Im loving it! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
14554,2,5 years ago,4 stars,It was clean. It was not too crowded. The items I ordered were up fast. It's a place to go when you don't have a lot of dough and not a lot of time. I try to eat healthy but sometimes you just need something fast.
14555,2,2 years ago,5 stars,"First time to this location, came at night (between 10pm and midnight) and was pleasantly surprised how fresh everything was and made to order, the fries were fantastic and my GF loved the Oreo McFlurry.

Nasty personal,nigth time manager it's the more inefficient person to rule a place,no brain,incredible how this person work in a restaurant. Never comes back."
14557,2,3 years ago,1 star,All I ordered was 2 mcribs for $6 drive-thru. They asked me to pull into parking lot and wait. Ended up waiting 25 minutes before I got my order. They claimed the manager couldn't find me. It is a very small parking lot. The manager didn't try very hard. I ended up calling them to remind them about my order. They came out with the same mcribs and handed them to me by this time the were slightly warm and very soggy. The only explanation I got was we're so sorry. I just left immediately otherwise I would have lost my cool if I stayed. Ended up just throwing my order away after one bite. Lost my appetite.
14558,2,2 years ago,1 star,Bad Service Bad Attitude! Gave me the wrong drink and charge me for 2 sandwiches when I ordered one. I was in a hurry to the office (around 8AM) and I didn't have time to argue. When I got to second window and I was handed the bag and the window shut by someone who looked like she'd rather be anywhere but there. Terrible service.

14560,2,4 years ago,5 stars,"I only eat McDonald's once or twice a year, and after 22 years in the neighborhood this location is - in my experience - the best of the chain within a mile of the length of Ventura Blvd.  Fries have always been fresh.

14564,2,2 years ago,2 stars,"I've given this location a few chances over the last two years and while the drive thru is fast, the drinks taste wrong every time. Something about their soda machine is just not working like other locations and hasn't been for a long time."
14565,2,7 months ago,1 star,This McDonald's is garbage. Dirty. No soda. Only take orders from 1 of the 2 lanes. Nope.
14566,2,4 years ago,5 stars,This is one of the best McDonald's. Place is clean and it gets quite a bit of traffic. Parking is tight but the drive thru(24 hrs) is short. The staff is mostly young professionals and they represent themselves well. Great fast food.
14567,2,3 years ago,4 stars,Little bit of a wait but that's pretty much everything in LA chicken came out hot and they remembered the sauces. The location didn't look too shabby but if they had a larger parking lot they could probably not contribute to the traffic on the street.  It's McDonald's not a chic-fil-a  you get what you pay for
14568,2,5 years ago,5 stars,Nice clean location. Customer service was super friendly and professional. Nice seating available. Outside seating also available. This location has 24 hr drive through. Overall great experience. Keep up the good work!

14572,2,6 years ago,2 stars,"Every time I've eaten there I've never seen an employee clean or wipe down a table.  Always sticky and I've had  to use water and napkins to clean the tables before eating.  I'd think they would at least watch and take care of this situation.   Also, very drafty from AC over tables and if you want to have warm food eat fast.   I've asked if they could turn the AC down a bit, but they said they couldn't.
Picking another MD now."
14573,2,5 years ago,5 stars,"Carlos, the young man running the front, was so friendly and all smiles even though he was getting overran and I myself was a bit of a problem for him as I had 5 kids who ordered 10 minutes apart from each other and changed their order twice. He still managed to take it all in stride and got us our food in a reasonable amount of time and with a smile on his face!"
14574,2,6 years ago,4 stars,"A little small for my taste. It is one of the older McDonalds, so it doesn't have outlets.
The staff is great, though! There is one dude that works in the morning that is always so nice, and it seems like he never has a bad day! None of the staff (as far as I have seen) discriminate against homeless people. Their humanity gets them the extra star!"
14575,2,4 years ago,4 stars,"Beware of the parking, it is very crowded and the drive through is inconveniently located  very closely to row of cars backing up and when gets crowded, if you are backing up you may have to wait or  even worse get hit by a car backing up (I actually saw this).  Not a big fan of McDonalds food, but the fries are classic and a tea no sugar is refreshing.  My order is always small fries and large tea no sugar.  Service is always great."
14576,2,3 years ago,2 stars,"The drive thru girl lied to me and the mgr stepped in to assist and the next time I went there, I started out happy and said hi
She did not answer....wierdo!

Not cool to hold grudges.  I don't.  Every day, is a new day and a chance to clean up messes.  She could fix it and apologize but, she chooses to ack like a child!"
14577,2,6 years ago,4 stars,This place has clean restroom. The parking is free but is mostly full and requires some wait to park. The dining area is not so big but clean. The cashier was friendly and welcoming. I like that breakfast was served all day.
14578,2,2 years ago,1 star,"I was there this morning at 10:00 a.m., thinking about ordering breakfast and coffee. The woman on the intercom wasn't really friendly and did not explain to me why they were not serving breakfast at this time. I thought breakfast was served throughout the day no matter what but I guess I was wrong. I've never had an issue with this McDonald's but this was a first and disappointing"
14579,2,2 years ago,3 stars,"Google keeps bugging me to review it, so here goes:    It's Mcdonald's. You know what you're in for when you go.  There's always a 50/50 chance that your fries will be hot and delicious, or cold and nasty.  I'll only add that this particular McD's suffers from being next door to one of the largest homeless encampments in LA.  Be prepared to be asked (usually politely) by a transient for food.
Of course, this isn't really the fault of the McDonald's, and I'm not making any judgements. I eat here frequently, since it's just off the freeway near my house, and McD's in general has improved their food over the past few years."
14580,2,2 years ago,1 star,"This Asian guy on the second window asks me to drive to their parking area because the order is not ready and said he will bring it to me. I waited for 10 minutes in the car and he never brought it.  I decided to walk in the restaurant, they had the bag just laying there.

Why would he ask me to wait in the car if he never planned on bringing it to me??  Bad service!"
14581,2,6 years ago,3 stars,"It's McDonald's. Their menu is growing, and has a number of new additions that look to be a bit healthier, but I come for the comfort of a Big Mac or Whopper.  This location is situated in an area that limits parking, and the drive through fills up the the point where it causes issues on the street. There's minimal seating (although I've always found a table). It is clean, and the staff the normal level of friendly and helpful."
14582,2,4 years ago,1 star,"My whole order was a lost, the oatmeal was not closed correctly and so all the order got wet and the oatmeal did not cook right .Then, they didn't even supply me with spoons. I asked for cream and sugar in my coffee, and they gave it to me black and  they got upset because asked them please add what I had asked for, in my coffee.
I ordered two breakfast burritos and they were cold, it's frustrating how bad some employees are trained they don't have any pride on what they do, nor care about service they provide is just a shame."
14583,2,3 years ago,5 stars,"As always, McDonald's prices are good for your pocketbook. Bought it for my three little friends and they were very full. And my wallet was very happy. Very friendly employees as well."
14584,2,3 years ago,1 star,"We ordered our food (It was free egg mcmuffin day) and before we even sat down they brought it to us, clearly it was made before we ordered. It was cold in the middle. They proceeded to stare, whisper, and laugh at us. I was uncomfortable eating the food, afraid they had spit in it so we left without touching a thing."
14585,2,10 months ago,3 stars,Soda was just fizzy water. Burger was undercooked. Fries were good and hot.
14586,2,3 years ago,5 stars,"Although it took longer than I expected to dine on, there was actually service and concern from the attentive  staff. And I really like the burgers. I get a qtr pounder with cheese and dont eat the  bottom bun.  To cut carbs. If you do it quickly the cheese doesn't melt so it very easy to go openfaced!"
14587,2,2 years ago,3 stars,What more can you say about McDonald's. It's what it is and their prices just keep getting higher. Fast food used to also be remotely inexpensive. Now they think they are fine dining with their prices going up quarterly.
14588,2,9 months ago,1 star,Lazy people very rude when they fall behind which is alot they dont use the register and wont help with kiosk they need new staff
14589,2,3 years ago,3 stars,I'm giving this McDonald's location a 3 star rating. This was due to the fact that their fries weren't all that great and meat was a bit oily in the quarter pound burger. I've also noticed that the quality of their buns aren't what they used to be. Not sure if I'm the only one who's noticed the change.
14590,2,4 years ago,1 star,"It took several minutes for someone to take our order, then our order took forever and was wrong. My Mc muffin was rock hard and instead of the cheeseburger my friend ordered he received a Mc chicken with cheese. they were out of sweet tea and the little straw trash bin on the soda fountain was bursting out and spilling into the ice catch. This facility is dirty, packed both inside and in the drive thru, and is obviously understaffed."
14591,2,7 years ago,1 star,"They got my order wrong... This happens often.

To make things worse they are very inefficient. Ordered a small fries, they served 10 other people before I got mine. Seriously, fill up a small bag with fries while you await other order burgers. I used to worl at McDonalds 10 years ago and know how it should be run. Horrible!

Ironically two other individuals complained about their order while I waited and one got into an argument with the manager over cold cheese."
14592,2,5 years ago,2 stars,"The drive through at this McDonald's has always been busy every time I've gone.  It's honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry.  I've been stuck in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger.  Granted, compared to In and Out that's nothing, but this is McDonalds.  That aside, the interior has always been pretty clean when I've went inside.  If you go for breakfast on the weekends, once again, be prepared to wait.  They do take Apple Pay and Android pay!  The one time I used it, the person behind the counter actually knew what it was.  So many places tell you they don't have it but just don't know what it is.  Another big plus is the drive through is 24 hours."
14593,2,3 months ago,5 stars,It's a McDonald's like any other.
14594,2,a year ago,5 stars,I am so happy and glad that they finally reopen. And a new remodel is amazing really nice.
14595,2,6 years ago,5 stars,"Great, friendly, efficient service for a quick bite in the car. The fast food was served piping hot and the sauce to meat ratio was on target...French fries were seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of crunch."
14596,2,10 months ago,5 stars,Cool new McD's with the kitchen on the Top floor.  Needs sum better decor very plain
14597,2,4 years ago,1 star,"The staff who took our order doesn't have customer service. Very impatient. In fairness he is so quick taking our order and he knows his menu.
Sad that frappe machine doesn't work.
No choice as thia is the only place that's open for breakfast here at universal."
14598,2,5 years ago,1 star,"I ordered a Mcdouble, which was on their outside drive thru menu. When it came up on the order screen it was shown as a Bacon Mcdouble, I told them that I just wanted the regular Mcdouble, no bacon. So all they did was note NO Bacon, and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble. When I got to the window I clarified again, but was told they didn't have that in their system, and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble. I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn't have what I ordered. I told him to go out and check his menu, because it was on there. He told me he didn't need to, that it was not on the menu. He was very rude and dismissive. I realize it is just a few cents difference, but why should anyone pay for something they didn't order, especially if what you ordered is on the menu. I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally, and rudely. I don't recommend visiting this McDonalds, luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect."
14599,2,6 years ago,1 star,"Drive thru order was botched. We paid for two milks and upon arriving home, discovered that there were no milks and instead of the healthier grilled chicken that my wife ordered, she was unable to eat the crispy chicken that we received due to dietary reasons...what a waste. Hopefully somebody got the milks we bought-

Avoid the drive thru at all costs! This was not the first time; and we should have stopped and checked the order-

Never again"
14600,2,2 years ago,1 star,I just left there 10 mins ago and my fries were horrible. They weren't even fresh and definitely something I would NEVER give to a customer
14601,2,a year ago,5 stars,"Got the spicy nuggets, everything was great! HUGE shoutout to Michael on staff, legendary experience with him!!"
14602,2,a year ago,4 stars,It's McDonald's but not too bad considering they just completely remodeled the place. The kitchen is now upstairs and it has smaller foot print with a bigger more organized parking area.
14603,2,3 years ago,1 star,Had a terrible experience from start to finish.. An order taker in the drive thru even though there was not a back up- he interrupted my ordering- got it wrong(i corrected him)- the cashier had it wrong(i corrected him)- then they handed me the wrong order- then the fish sandwich was burnt and tasted old and the chicken nuggets tasted like very bad chicken.. Worst McDonald's experience ever.
14604,2,5 years ago,1 star,I asked for a peppermint mocha and all was well until I realized the hot cup they served it in was cold by the time it was too late and I was already home. Drive thru service not the best when you have to yell out the order multiple times.
14605,2,4 years ago,3 stars,As far as a McDonald's chain restaurant would go I can say that this is a decent location it's really a McDonald's so I don't know how much you could realistically expect out of a place like this you know a fast food chain but the food here is on par with any other McDonald's is there The drive-thru is relatively quick which is good
14606,2,4 years ago,4 stars,"As far as McDonalds go, this is a pretty good one. Know how I can tell? Fries are *always* blistering hot.  I live near this McDonald's and I don't have to force myself to come here even though I pick up food 2 or 3 times per month. Stuff that's supposed to be hot is hot; stuff that is supposed to be cold is cold. As far as the service goes, here's the amazing thing: mostly millennials are working here .... and the service is still good! If you are in the area and hungry, I recommend this McDonald's....but please don't tease the Millinials they get spooked easy and stampede.  Thanks."
14607,2,4 years ago,4 stars,It's a little bit hard to get in and out of the parking lot other than that everybody is very nice and it's a good facility they don't run as many specials or deals like by two or buy one get one free on the breakfast sandwiches and stuff like a lot of other McDonald's do so that's why I didn't give him five stars other than that the place is clean and they're good
14608,2,4 years ago,2 stars,"My brother and I tolerate it because it's close to us and it's open when no one else is.  But. .. you get the loonies showing up there. Homeless wandering in and out filling up for free their gutter cups at the soda machine. Smells, psych ward cryouts and who knows what else are the norm so do yourself a favor and order by the drive through and get the hell out quick."
14609,2,6 years ago,2 stars,"bad night. went for a burger. got trapped in the drive thru. took almost ten min to get to the order screen, only to find out their grill was down. and they aren't cooking meat, just nuggets. trapped for another ten minutes, for a total of almost twenty minutes with nothing to show for it. things happen, just put a damn sign up."
14610,2,10 months ago,4 stars,"McDonald's is awesome, get the app with that you can get 99 cent large iced coffee!"
14611,2,6 years ago,4 stars,Small but very busy McDonald's location with a drive thru.  They offer their standard menu and service is reasonably fast.  They do have extra attendants working the drive thru during busy hours to try and move traffic along.
14612,2,7 months ago,5 stars,I ate so many big mac. A  Lot. 4. I love mcdanal an big Mac plz

14616,2,10 months ago,2 stars,t's fast food they take like 20-30 for an order and all the tables are dirty
14617,2,5 years ago,4 stars,It's McDonalds. If you don't know to check your bags before you pull away then you've never been to a fast food restaurant before. The service was friendly and the new menu items are fun to try. Seriously though it doesn't deserve one Star reviewing... I've been to some true one Star places and this isn't one of them.
14618,2,a year ago,3 stars,Small McDonalds. Clean. The restrooms were locked and I had to find somebody to let me in. That always frustrates me. The place had about 50% of the staff needed to meet the crowd.
14619,2,5 years ago,3 stars,"Small and cramped inside always seems busy. Parking lot is small too, but drive through delivers standard menu mostly reliably. Easy access to freeway at this location too."
14620,2,5 years ago,1 star,"Stopped here on the way to LA. Every employee i talked to had TERRIBLE customer service. Everyone there looks miserable. I heard a man ask to enter the mens restroom to just wash his hands while they were cleaning, the person cleaning refused and then he asked the lady at the register if he could ask the person cleaning to let him inside the restroom and she told him to go to the womens restroom with a huge attitude! Really rude workers."
14621,2,7 years ago,4 stars,"This place has a small parking lot, but the inside is generally clean and cool. The soda machines Diet Dr Pepper tastes a little off, other than that the service is good and the food is well put together."
14622,2,4 years ago,3 stars,"So/so McDonald's but it's the closest to the house. They could do a much better job of cleaning it and also getting rid of the vagrants the sit for hours. If you're looking for friendly service, don't bother but it's mcdonald's, who come for the service. They drive thru is fine but gets way backed up"
14623,2,5 years ago,3 stars,This isnt IN n OUT and people do actually want to look at the menu... so having your employees stand outside in the hot sun... around the corner from the full menu... taking orders with an out dated sandwich board is pretty ridiculous. (I ordered a #7 from the board... which was a #6 in his tablet) so my order was wrong...Why can't we simply order thru the box like normal drive-thrus McDonald's
14624,2,3 years ago,3 stars,"Hey what can I say? But!!!!! Sure make not just good - Damn good hot French Vanilla Latte with whipped cream on top! I like it so much they recognize my voice coming thru the drive thru in Sherman Oaks. The only thing I like better is when someone brings it home to me and we put just a timble full of Bristole Cream, or Kalua, or my fav-o-rite Pennsylvania Dutch Egg Nog in it! Oooh weeeee! Better watch that Penn Dutch. Sure will creep up on you though!"
14625,2,a year ago,4 stars,They know how you make early morning coffee taste yummy to the last drop.
14626,2,3 years ago,1 star,"Never a correct order - last night they forgot to put patties on both kid's hamburger buns, the kitchen timers are always beeping, not very clean, parking is limited. Staff is friendly. Kids like it so we'll continue to come here."
14627,2,5 years ago,4 stars,I used to work across the street so I would go there quite often. Usually quick. On occasion I would wait 20 minutes to get my order. Otherwise good service.
14628,2,7 years ago,1 star,"Slow. All. The. Time. I have never come to this location and quickly got my good and out, it's always this long process (just for my order to be wrong).  I wish they put in the attention to detail that the Studio City location puts in."
14629,2,2 years ago,1 star,"Went in here to us the restroom, since im working outside, got a no. Thank you coffee been for the yes. To show my appreciation, I bought a drink."
14630,2,a month ago,1 star,Worst McDonalds ever. Staff try but automated and crowded
14631,2,2 years ago,3 stars,"Drive-thru. But just afterwards I found out the news that McDonald's is supporting terrorists, Hamas, and suddenly against Israel. So I won't be going back to McDonald's until that changes."
14632,2,2 years ago,5 stars,"This McDonald's ice cream machine has never once been broken anytime I've ordered ice cream, and that's literally the most I could ask of any fast food establishment."
14633,2,8 months ago,5 stars,My fa our place for coffee. Always we make sure we get the senior coffee.
14634,2,6 months ago,2 stars,"It takes forever to get breakfast here, every time inside and out"
14635,2,6 months ago,2 stars,Cold nuggets.  Homeless people just walking around cars.
14636,2,4 years ago,1 star,"Terrible, floor was disgusting and no one cleaned it after asking, even the tables were left a mess that my family had to clean ourselves. Unfriendly atmosphere and employees looked at us in anger despite just walking in. Would not recommend anyone this establishment"
14637,2,7 years ago,3 stars,"Very happy. That old prejudice of food places regarding ""no substitutions"" is finally being put to rest, and this particular McDonalds location is at the forefront of that movement. They really do try to accommodate people,for instance, who love pancakes and eggs, but don't eat pork. Hold the sausage but you like hashbrowns? No problem! Hooray! Maybe Jack Nicholson will come in and order a turkey sandwich."
14638,2,a year ago,1 star,Took 40 whole minutes from the time I entered the drive through before I got my food.
14639,2,3 years ago,5 stars,Super clean. Amazing customer service and the vibes here are really great. This location is in my top 3 favorite McDonald restaurants.

14642,2,2 years ago,5 stars,Service member that took my order was my lifesaver this morning. God bless you and your family plus staff members. #framily
14643,2,5 years ago,2 stars,"It's a McDonald's so the food is very consistent. Unfortunately, the parking lot is impossible to use since the drive through wraps through it. I've been stuck in the parking lot for 20 minutes with no way to get out."
14644,2,5 years ago,1 star,Bad exsperence two days in a row no mc rib! Drive through slow no matter what time i go there. Fries old on several different occasions. Isaac the night manager was sweet!
14645,2,3 years ago,5 stars,"My burger was fresh cooked, perfect in every way. The fried were hot. Fast friendly service. Great mc donalds."
14646,2,4 years ago,1 star,"Upon leaving this McDonald's on Friday morning. I turned around just in time to see a  Rat, Not a mouse ,A GINOURMOUS RAT!!
I Kid you not, this Heavy Hitter was the size of a Men's Shoe Size 12!!!
I was amazed at how tame it was...
Kinda scary the way it just lingered in the parking lot without a worry in the world.
Maybe It was Stuart Little and was waiting for his food in the drive thru.
Unsure , either way, If you come To this McDonald's you might be blessed with his Presence..
Enjoy your McMuffin!! ï¿½ï"
14647,2,a year ago,4 stars,It was very busy for the time I came in. I had a 15 minute wait on my food
14648,2,7 years ago,1 star,"Third time this year that the drive thru got my order wrong, and I've only been four times!  And the manager expected me to get back in my car, drive back to the restaurant and wait in line again to get it fixed- I don't think so!"
14649,2,3 years ago,5 stars,This location always seems to be on top of their game.  The drive thru line at rush hour goes quickly and the servers are friendly and efficient.  Love this McDonalds!
14650,2,8 months ago,2 stars,"Gross bathrooms, you know it's sketchy because they have security outside of it."
14651,2,2 years ago,1 star,Not a good service nd i asked for ranch nd ketchup they didnt served me anything just becus they wanted to have a fast drive through
14652,2,5 years ago,2 stars,Like stepping back into the 70s.. this place hasn't been updated for many decades by the looks of it. Very old fashioned. Food a little greasy and saltier than other McDonald's branches I've been to.
14653,2,5 years ago,4 stars,"I guess for a McDonald's, it deserves 5 stars because it was perfectly a normal McDonald's, but it is still the lowest common denominator when looking for food, so...

Don't expect ""more than McDonald's"", but it was clean and the food was hot."
14654,2,3 years ago,5 stars,Loved it ordered the new beacon extreame burgar without onions. Nice choice from Spain. The lobby is clean and neat and the service is quick.

14658,2,4 years ago,5 stars,It's open 24 hours (the drive through at least) so you can get that item your craving for day or night! Good service & friendly staff!
14659,2,2 years ago,1 star,The afternoon crew over there is very ignorant and arrogant! I don't know if that was just an incident or that's there normal but It was unpleasant to order from them!

14663,2,4 years ago,2 stars,The McDonald's I just went to was so filthy I didn't even eat there. The parking lot was disgusting all around the outside of the building was really filthy. Inside was better but not by that much.
14664,2,4 years ago,1 star,People brought their own food to this place (like 12 people) yams and hard boiled eggs and ordered2 sandwiches and 12 coffees and too all the tables.  People were complaining but management did nothing
14665,2,4 years ago,1 star,"The food there sucks, it is so tasteless & I've even got a sausage mcmuffin here & it wasn't done, plus the coke is really bad.. no coke just seltzer water... never again"

14688,2,2 years ago,5 stars,Always quick and easy out of this location They managed to keep this place very clean
14689,2,a year ago,1 star,It appears this location burned down or was leveled for reconstruction.  There is no building only steel support beams and a fence around the lot.
14690,2,3 years ago,5 stars,It's fast food right? But the service was friendlier than you'd normally associate with fast food and that was from interacting with three different

15278,2,a year ago,1 star,"My order is WRONG every time; the most frustrating customer experience. I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel, and I've concluded that this location is a 120% mess. If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases. I ask for no cheese every time, and guess what is in my order.. CHEESE. Or my frys are half full, or the hashbrowns are completely missing, no syrup/ utensils are in the bag as requested. On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order, an employee brings out an incorrect order.. yes 3 times. Today this ""New"" team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it... what the hell? Every other time I let the incorrect order slide, but today I decided to speak with the store manager. I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders, and she replies ""Sorry"", I then ask ""what is mcdonalds doing about this, its every time the order is wrong?"" She responds ""I'm so sorry""... I ask again and same response.  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago, they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it.... this new location is a joke, its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this, and its been a few months since their brand new building opened."

It's so easy to think of these places as just another installment in a gigantic corporation, but I think it's important to remember that these places are made up of the individuals who work there

For that reason, after coming here for a couple of years, I have to say that they do a phenomenal job. I only ever go through the drive-thru, but after being so used to no smiles, miserable demeanors and a lack of basic customer service skills (thank you, have a nice day), I need to shout out how friendly and consistent everyone at the drive-thru line is here.

The women who take your payment are always nice, and even the woman who hands out the food (usually a job where you will get absolutely zero smiles) is always so nice and genuine.

If somebody owns a business and is looking for a good customer service and people who will treat customers as expected, then give people a shot based on everyday encounters like these."

Happy meals had toys, one was missing its apples and I didn't get my drink. Every thing was corrected without issue, it would just be nice to get everything right the first time.

15303,33,9 months ago,1 star,"The absolute worst McDonald's I've ever dealt with. The most incompetent management I've ever experienced.
First 2 out of my last 3 breakfast orders were wrong. But didn't realize until I got to work. I cannot leave my job to go back.
Then today I got a steak, egg, and cheese bagel. Which was right with the exception of 2 long black hairs in it.
I stopped back on my way home and asked for a manager.
The first manager only asked for a receipt. She then left and got another manager. She was a heavy set black woman. She was the most ignorant, vile person that I've ever dealt with. Not even an apology. Her response was to bring it back? 5 hours later? When I said that was ridiculous, she closed the window and walked away. I asked for a corporate phone number and she refused.
I called and I can only assume it was the same ignorant woman because she put the phone down and left it off the hook.
I called again for the phone number and she said its on my receipt and hung up.
She is clearly incompetent and doesn't deserve her jib.
Funny thing is I didn't ask for anything free! An I'm sorry may have been enough.
But nothing even close. I would never recommend this dump of a McDonald's nor the clearly racist manager.
I will stop at nothing now to make sure she can't treat anyone like this again"
15304,33,4 years ago,1 star,"Whatever you do, do NOT go to this McDonald's location. There's a reason why I rated it one star and I can kindly explain why. While the food there is good, I simply cannot stare at these people the same way anymore. A hour or two ago, I showed up to get some food and there was this one woman working behind the register (I don't remember her name, but I assume she was a manager or something. She was in a blue shirt and glasses and that's all I can remember). There was an annoying beeping sound that seemed concerning and I politely asked (key word here is ""politely"") them to investigate it and make it stop. They didn't bother to check it, which shows that they're neglectful of the resources around their workplace. The reaction I got from this woman was 100% disrespectful and told me to get out of her store and never come back and even tried to call 911 on me. It's pretty obvious that I caught this woman on a bad day. Clearly, I was furious because I felt like she was deliberately trying to get under my skin and using that to her advantage. You know what they call people like her? A bully. I was bullied by the manager because I had a concern that needed to be addressed. I was not trying to show up on this woman at any point during my visit. I was trying to be as lenient as I possibly could. If the woman I was referring to was actually a manager of this establishment, she needs to be put in her place because that's NOT how a manager should treat her customers. I do not like being antagonized, especially by an employee and it really showed during this visit. Come to think about it, I've been checking on other reviews of this location they all had numerous problems with this particular person. Obviously, I'm heartbroken because now I don't have anywhere to go to eat after my work shift. I'm only relegated to the Chick-Fil-A a minute down the road and even I know they have better hearts and respect than this woman did (and their food is also good). As a man diagnosed with autism, I strongly advise people to stay away from this location at all costs. If you really need to go to a McDonald's, steer clear of this location. It's not worth your time and it's not worth your sanity. Also, their drink machine has been broken and flat for at least a few months and they didn't fix that either. I will be contacting corporate about the antics going afoot at this location."

Looks like management has posted a sign, order via kiosk to get a free cookie. My order didn't contain one. I asked the associate, she was puzzled. They had to discuss with 3 other folks and finally one of them gave one with complete displeasure.

Kiosk didn't give a paper bill to provide a direct feedback. With modern tech, they should switch to a sms or email for whoever wants a digital copy."
15312,33,a year ago,1 star,I ordered breakfast sandwiches and hash browns. It was 12 in the afternoon so I didn't mind pulling to the side to wait. After 15 minutes no one had come out yet. I went inside and by the time I talked to the manager it had been 20 minutes. She told me it was my fault because I ordered breakfast at noon and was INCREDIBLY rude with an unbelievable attitude. I told her I wanted my money back. She ignored me. Five minutes later I started asking every employee if I could have my money back. The manager first ignored me and then started yelling. I finally had to call my wife inside to deal with her because she was so unprofessional. 30 minutes had gone by at this point. Worst run restaurant I've ever been to.

To top it off, I walked into the bathroom. There was someone sitting in the stall. He flushed and walked out. He was an employee and he didn't wash his hands. Just walked out of the bathroom and when I came out he was making burgers. Disgusting!"

Than waited well over 5 mins then to pay and there was only 1 car besides me in line and they waited a while to pay as well.  Then to not get my order properly made and then was told my order was made correctly and that next time I would be charged extra for what they had to do, which was to make my order right !

I asked for a macchiato.  Got a large cup of sugar and cream WITH A SQUIRT OF ESPRESSO. I wanted macchiato not a cup of creamer and sugar. I asked for more espresso to be added and got attitude about it and was told they would have to charge me more next time FOR THE ESPRESSO! They clearly do not realize what an macchiato is! It has espresso in it and not just a 7th of cup of espresso! Manager was not helpful. Said that's the way its made. I said no its not. I've been to many other McDonald's and this isn't how they make it. I also have had this at a lot of other coffee places and that what they gave me wasn't a macchiato. He said I work at 3 other McDonald's no its not. So I told him which one I like to go to that makes it right. So then he proceeds to say we'll that is how our machine makes it. Didn't want to help. Just argue and get rid of me. I didn't appreciate being treated like I was and that I would be charged for wanting espresso in my drink that is supposed to have espresso!
Could tell they were not having a good night and dint seem to care to make things right and wanted  to just get rid of me.So I took my stuff and  left."

The place was fairly clean, and service wasn't terrible, but it wasn't stellar either. They originally forgot the cookies my friend ordered, and when they did get them for him, the didn't have all 3 chocolate chip, so they gave him 2 of those and 1 sugar cookie. I understand that, but rather than just telling him, ""Hey, we got you 2 of those and 1 of these,"" they should have asked, ""Since we only have 2 chocolate chip, can we give you those and 1 sugar cookie?"" That's just polite. Also, the ketchup was out, even though they clearly weren't busy. All this being said, they took the order quickly, apart from that were friendly enough, and got the food out fast without any mistakes (apart from that). If I'm in the area, I might stop by, but the McDonald's in Marlton is much better."

The employee heads towards the register to take my order. She says she hopes she can use it. She took my order but had to have help. I didn't mean to be flippant but I said ""so you're job is to help people at the kiosks?"" She said yes. The food was ok, the place was clean but my point here is, this is what's going to happen with a 15 dollar  minimum wage. One person will be employed to oversee the kiosks but people lost their jobs already and replaced by machines. I'd rather keep a human working than have them replaced by a machine, not to mention how many germs are on said machine that they want you to order food from. About a month ago there was a story on the news that almost 99 percent of kiosks tested (everywhere) had a presence of fecal matter. So no kiosks or self checkout for me."

I wonder if there is a manager here because the employees seem more intent on fooling around and laughing than paying attention to their customers.  They need to get things straightened out and realize that if they don't provide better service, they will go out of business.

15343,33,4 years ago,2 stars,"I was not given a receipt otherwise I would've complained privately.

I pulled into the drive thru around 2:50 PM. It was about a one or two minute wait before me and the woman in the second drive thru lane were answered. Before that, someone must have accidentally switched their headset on because all I heard was a lot of laughing and talking in the background.

When I pulled around to pay, the woman at the first window wasn't able to locate my order for a moment. But she triple checked to make sure that what she had was accurate. So I paid, received my change, and she shut the window without another word (or my receipt.)

I pull up to the next window to get my food and drinks. The girl at that window double checked which order was mine, then handed me my food. Even though I ordered a large Coke, I was given a medium Coke but didn't see any use in complaining because I didn't want to hold her lane up.

When I pulled away, I started eating my medium fry only to discover that the top fries were over salted and mushy. I figured they must've got mixed in with the fresh fries and kept eating. I was wrong. They only got worse. They got mushier and more stale. Like someone had reheated them in a microwave. Absolutely disgusting. I was too annoyed at that point to turn around and go all the way back. I don't expect fries to be perfect all the time, but I do expect not to get the fries that should've been written off as waste.

The only reason that I'm doing 2 stars instead of 1 is because the teens here are very nice. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is okay. Especially when I'm inside using the kiosk. But something about food quality and drive thru efficiency needs to be revamped. This isn't the first time I've received stale fries or had an order done incorrectly at this location. I only come here because this is the only McDonald's on my route that doesn't put me out of the way, but the lack of efficiency is seriously frustrating."

So I would advise people to take as much time as you need in the Drive-Thru to make sure you have all your food that you actually ordered

The young lady taking the order misunderstood me when I be asked for a Orange drink and charged for a Orange juice.

I wet around the drive through again spoke to the manager and she apologized. Last visit to this McDonald's.
15361,33,3 years ago,1 star,"This is the most unprofessional McDonalds I have EVER ordered from. I ordered using uber eats and when my food arrived it was packaged with stickers stuck all around the bag where as I could barely open the bag. There is a gaping hole in the bag and this is not even to mention the poor quality of the food. Half of the food was cold, my hashbrown was crushed and bent, and my sandwich was poorly packaged. No care went into the process of my order. I do not recommend anyone to purchase anything as little as a water bottle from this establishment. I am sick to my stomach at the fashion my food was given to me in. NEVER AGAIN!"

15370,33,3 years ago,1 star,"I went to the McD's on Rt 561 at (Roughly) 21:45hrs to get a 1/4 pounder meal with a milkshake. During the ordering, a woman loudly voiced acrossed the floor to the young lady assisting me that she is NOT to take ANY ice cream orders after 21:30.
The employee was as stunned as I and ask why and in an Arrogant voice. She said ""its because we GOTZ ( gotz) to clean the machine"" Well I felt this was rude and followed up with a question to this woman. I asked,  what if I get here at 21:45 and ask for a milkshake. She again in an Arrogant voice responded with, "" you aintz getting it"" ( aint'z) ( The rest of the staff laughed when she made this comment)
After all this and being made to wait 15 minutes for my order, I requested a refund and to speak to the manager. I was told by this woman that no manager was available.
So I went back the next day to report this incident, I ask the front customer representative to speak with a manager. Oddly enough, she directed my attention to the woman that I had this encounter with the night before.
So not only did I get HORRIBLE customer service in a language and tone that was less than professional, I was lied to as the customer service rep..AKA Manager Nicky was available the whole time.
If Nicky is the Manager and is leading that team, it won't be long until that location starts losing customers as they just loss 1...

I would go elsewhere to eat!"
15371,33,4 years ago,1 star,"Ok, here goes... I stopped into the location on Rt73 in west Berlin NJ  for lunch today. The drive through line was super long so I parked and went I side. I ordered a number 5 (artisan chicken sandwich) meal. I paid, waited like 15 minutes, they called my number and I brought my ticket to the counter and took my bag. I got to work and found out I didn't get a chicken sandwich but instead I got a big mac. Which normally wouldn't be an issue but I hate big macs, I've gotten sick eating one before and ever since I can't even look at a big mac without getting sick to my stomach. Needless to say I wasn't happy. I threw the bag in my car and went on with the rest of my work day... on the way home I stopped back in and brought the bag of food back to McDonald's. The manager named Rebecca came to the counter and I told her what happened and I showed her all of the food I got and explained to her what I was supposed to get.(keep in mind I didn't even touch a fry) She was super rude to me and said she can't do anything because I didn't save my receipt. I don't know about anyone else but I always hand my ticket in when they call my number to prove that it's my food they're handing out. And I asked her what's the difference between a receipt and the untouched food that I brought back? I asked for a refund because I was no longer hungry, she said no, I asked for a new meal, after 5 minutes of her spouting off why she couldn't make it right, she finally gave in and walked away from me huffing and puffing and yelled to the back ""make an artisan chicken sandwich"" so a couple minutes later someone put a bag with just the sandwich in it on the counter and I asked where the fries were and she said, ""there was nothing wrong with the fries earlier, just the sandwich"" so this miserable poop butt of a manager refused to give me fresh French fries with my sandwich and handed me back the old fries from 6 hours ago. She took this whole interaction so personal and was acting like the money was coming out of her pocket. My final argument was asking her if she thought I was lying and did she think I made the big mac and fries at my house and brought it in to pull one over on her? What a horrible experience. It sucks when you get 30 minutes for lunch and you're starving and wind up not being able to eat and it's someone else's fault. You want someone to make it right. Instead this manager who gets to use her little bit of power to make up her own rules and make it difficult for you. Like it would of ruined her entire life to fix their error and make it right. It just sucked, I'll NEVER go back there just because of her. And I hope no one else will either. That's how pissed if this whole mess made me..."

Update Oct 2019: Last three times I've been, my Quarter Pounder bun has been stale and the ""never frozen"" patty was over-done and served way too fast to be cooked-to-order.  Disappointed that their quality is going down-hill.  The never-frozen 1/4 pound patties are worlds better than the frozen ones when they're cooked properly."

After that customer service blunder, she agreed to tell the person preparing my cheeseburgers not to put mustard on them.  Once we got our food, I had the unique experience of listening to her berate her cooking staff because they weren't going fast enough for the next 20 minutes while me and my 2 kids were trying to enjoy our meal.

Their rule is ""5 kids in the restaurant at a time"" because of an incident that happend a week ago where kids made a mess and broke a salt shaker. Two out of the group left and it was us 4 sitting there, having casual conversation in the side of the restaurant, and a second lady came up to us and asked us to leave again, because ""football kids are coming in"" and that there were too many kids at one time. Keep in mind we were not disrespectful or disruptive, McDonalds was just a place to eat, not hang out or lounge in our free time.

It has been the only place since my son was a baby that we have been able to go to get a quick bite to eat due to his severe dairy allergy. Yes they have a dairy free meal for him and for me a gluten free meal. A match you can't beat. I won't say how old my son is but McDonalds has been ahead of their time for over two decades now when it comes to having special meals. It's been a great place for our family to go.

Visited on the weekend,  so naturally busier, but the management, attitude of employees, and physical condition make this a location, in my opinion, the worst location weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve ever visited.
1. Trash everywhere, see pic for example. Trash on the floors, tables, parking lot.
2. Dirty tables. Obviously tables get dirty. So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitorï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s"

Charging me almost $30 for an order of pancakes and giving ME and attitude when it is THEIR mistake. I very calmly stated that there was an obvious mistake on the receipt, the cashier seemed new, but for some reason the manager thought it was appropriate to put the blame on ME and not their lack of being a good manager and training their employees properly. Disgusting behavior for a problem that required next to NO effort to fix, but the manager sought it better worth their time and effort to be nasty."

She said that the lady told her to cut in front of me and I said who and the manager of that McDonald's Sylvia said I did. I told her you almost caused a catastrophic accident and she said it's a two-lane and I said no ma'am and other people in line roll their windows down and said it's only a one lane and Sylvia argued with all of us that were  in line  waiting. You're going to have a catastrophic accident there if you don't get two lanes drawn up. Number two, Sylvia should not be arguing with the customers in line and she did not serve us. I never use profanity I told her it was unprofessional and that it could have caused an accident and other people were telling her the same.I'm very disappointed how McDonald's has lowered the bar in hiring people that will argue with their customers when the  are trying to prevent an accident.

I take my two-year-old granddaughter there occasionally, and she always has fun.

15892,3,a year ago,1 star,Good quick service! But the lady that works at night front counter is very rude. It's a way to say something. People are spending their money.
15893,3,3 years ago,3 stars,"When the order is correct, the quality is fine. But I never get an order completely correct, especially if it's a McCafe drink. I would let it go, everyone makes mistakes, but it's constant and employees as a manager have had a terrible attitude about fixing it. If there were another one to go to instead, I would."
15894,3,4 years ago,2 stars,"Went through the drive thru in a hurry to get my daughter to school, we found a hair in our food and was given the wrong drink. The manager on duty was very apologetic and gave me a refund. Even though I was disappointed with the hair in the food, we were treated very kindly and had no problem getting our money back"
15895,3,7 years ago,5 stars,"I'll always come back here. The food's always right and the store and bathroom is always clean. Nobody bothers you. I even ate pizza here and the management didn't seem to care and it's a good place to eat and work. There aren't too many good McDonald's you can find a good plug in for your laptop but this one is awesome.

The staff is good and very helpful every time I go there. One day I was low on money but really had to eat. One of the guys who worked there gave me a break and upsized my drink as a courtesy. It was hot as $h&t outside and I had a longer lasting drink to curve the heat."
15896,3,5 years ago,5 stars,"Actually an especially above average location.  Service and food are what should be expected.  Clean.  Restroom has hands free door opener.  Kids Play Place is especially nice.  Has modern play equipment, toddler area and interactive life size video game station."
15897,3,3 years ago,3 stars,"So I gave this a 3, mainly because they always get my order right. The customer service is not always there. Its hit or miss. Please Beware! The drive-thru has a narrow turn, I've seen too many cars scrape up the side hitting the barrier at the first window. It doesn't look like you're that close, but I promise, just take a wide turn in the drive-thru"
15898,3,a year ago,5 stars,I can only speak to their breakfast as it's the only thing I've purchased there. Service is fast and the food is great.
15899,3,4 years ago,5 stars,"Best McDonald's around!
The people who work there are always super nice, the service is very good compared to other McDonald's in this area. And there are NOT any of those horrible self serve kiosks! Oh how I hate those things!!!
The restaurant is clean and we'll maintained.
This is my favorite!"

15902,3,a year ago,5 stars,"Every once in awhile you just got to have a quarter pounder. Today it was a quarter pounder with fries and a Coke. So good. The Quarter Pounders are made with fresh meat now and you can really taste the difference. And everyone knows that McDonald's has the best Fountain Coke. They tested a couple of times per hour just to ensure the formula is Right. Plus, they have those nice fat straws that make for big sips. :-)"
15903,3,4 years ago,3 stars,"This Micky D's is pretty standard. The usual menu options, staff is quick and polite, they generally get your order right... However I am only giving 3 stars because they recently changed their hours and the location is only open until 11 PM daily. This used to be a reliable place for an extremely late night snack, but not anymore. Even the local Wendy's and Taco Bell are open later."

We ordered and they told us to pull around to the second window. We werenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t told our total.

15907,3,3 years ago,1 star,I went there today with no cars in front of me in the drivethru.I ordered one large Sweet tea it took over 5 minutes for them to get. I should've have just went and got a fountain drink from 7eleven. This one is always slow.
15908,3,4 years ago,1 star,"I went to McDonalds this morning for breakfast and got charged for an extra sandwich so I asked for a refund. they refunded the cheaper sandwich which was not the wrong one and I pointed it out and they said I was wrong and they refunded the right one, I was like okay whatever. then they closed to door to fix my drink. they apologize for my inconvenience, smile and tell me to have a nice day, handing over my drink. I get to work and realize they literally only filled it halfway. I was nothing but polite. Petty does not look good on you McDonalds."
15909,3,4 years ago,1 star,Third time in a row to get the hamburger happy meal with just ketchup only to have cheese added each time.  My child will not eat it if cheese has touched it. They have new toys for the kids however we keep getting toys that are 6 months old. Not a good location for the lack of service and food.
15910,3,5 years ago,1 star,"I went through the drive-thru and ordered 3 cheese burgers. I waited in line for like 10 minutes. I get to the window and they told me to park because my food wasn't ready. It wasn't even busy, so I didn't understand why it took so long to make 3 cheeseburgers. After waiting in my car for 10 more minutes, I went inside to get a refund since I had to go back to work and I just wasted 20 minutes waiting for food. As soon as I ask for a refund, one of the employees walks up with my food and hands it to me. I guess they forgot I was waiting on it? I will never come back to this location."

15912,3,3 years ago,2 stars,"I hate it when I point out a problem and the management tell me that that's the way its supposed to be.  I managed a McDonald's for many years.  I know better. I still order their food regularly all over the country.  I know better. The new manager has made things much better, but standards still slip back to the old ways when he's not here."
15913,3,5 years ago,1 star,"I usually defend fast food joints, even McDonalds. Not a very picky person. However this visit to this location was very disappointing. Defying all logic it took a very long time to get my food around noon on a Tuesday despite few cars.

15915,3,6 years ago,3 stars,"The food was McDonald's typical. I like the new design, but as many of them I've been to lately are, it was just filthy. I was there for over an hour and a half letting my kids eat and play and not once did I see anyone clean a table or anything off the floor. It would also be helpful for there to be napkins in the play area so you could clean up messes without leaving your kids or taking the whole crew with you."
15916,3,2 years ago,5 stars,They made a mistake on my order but I hadn't left the parking lot yet. I called them and told them and they gave me the correct sandwich right away. Great service!

15920,3,4 years ago,1 star,"Really frustrated with this location. I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there. I know exactly how much my order should be. I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual. 2 McDoubles. I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order. Or so I thought. Instead of paying $1.50 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 2 + .25 = $3.25, I was charged $1.99 for ONE Mcdouble. It may not seem like much, but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices. I wonder how much I've over paid at this location in the past!
What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order. So in order to determine why I paid $2.15 after tax for ONE Mcdouble, I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself. I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker, not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window. It should be standard procedure to give a receipt for the sake of the overpaying customers."
15921,3,4 years ago,2 stars,"Food was good. Everything was right, but they never have any of the toys offered on the mconalds preorder app exept for what they call inisex, which is really just for boys, and were very short with me and rude when i asked for a proper toy for my little 2 yr old daughter. She is obviously not into a avengers."
15922,3,2 years ago,5 stars,I've ubered and ordered at this particular McDonald's and I've always had a positive experience. They don't ignore you and they actually get to their customers in the order that they are in. Great team up there and positive work attitude!

15924,3,5 years ago,5 stars,"Love this spot. Convenient location right off of major highways, food is prepared properly, drive-thru turns over quickly, coffee is delicious. No complaints. This is what every McDonald's should be like."
15925,3,2 years ago,5 stars,"Fast service, hot fries fresh burgers. It's McD's. Somehow the food is fresher in our drive thru only world...

People at this one always are nice considering they need to deal with peeps like me that never know what they want. It's been the same basic menu for decades. LOL"
15926,3,9 years ago,1 star,"If I could give them no stars I would.. they have been messing up my order for year's. Remodel didn't help nothing,  still sucks. I've complained to a district manager,  don't help. I've had 1 nice manager,  but she still got my order wrong... I swear at one point I thought I was on boiling point, or there was a hidden camera. Cuz they got my order wrong 3x's in s row... this place is A JOKE...."
15927,3,5 years ago,4 stars,It's a pretty nice McDonald's. Not highest quality of food of course cuz it's fast food but I like the fries and getting deals. I've tried the mobile order a few times too and it's cool how they bring it to you and feels like there's less wait.
15928,3,5 years ago,3 stars,"This restaurant had an nice increase in customer service once new management took over (at least I think it was new MGMT), and a remodel. Now, however, they seem to be sliding back into giving constant wrong orders, not giving there sauces that they make you ask for (don't forget to ask for ketchup at the window, since they don't seem to want to take that part at the speaker).  We are back into driving to the Southlake location to give them it money since they rarely get our order wrong.  Thankfully, we don't eat McDonald's that often anymore, otherwise this review would be lower"
15929,3,3 years ago,1 star,"Got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and not even sure if there was chicken. Bit untonit and had a cold grey semi solid mass caked in flavorless breading. Fries were soggy and unappealing. Usually no matter what Mcds you go to you expect some consistancy, with this one in Roanoke you can expect consistent bad food. Stay clear of this place. Staff definitely doesn't care and to say the food is subpar would be a compliment."
15930,3,a year ago,5 stars,"If you don't know what you're getting into when you go to a McDonald's, you're probably coloring more often than reading. My Sprite tasted EXACTLY like Sprite."

Whataburger stayed open and served a limited menu to support Roanoke."
15932,3,10 years ago,2 stars,"This McDonalds sucks. They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive-thru, but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds: The management.

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive-thru timer, because you will always have to pull up at this McD's. Always. Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times (1 burger + fry at 3pm = pull up next to the 3-4 other cars already there).

The one manager I've had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well. I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order (that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for, no less) and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card. The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash. The best part? He made me pull up to get the cash.

So again: Mis-managed, terrible McDonalds. It's a franchise for a reason, this one just stinks."
15933,3,5 years ago,1 star,"Honestly, I hate to do this, but the moment I walked in, it smelled like a porta potty... and I was like ""let me just order"" I ordered 2 hot and spicy's NO LETTUCE, a large drink and a large fry. The Coke was ok, the fries like always (not full but fresh) and I got one sandwich with lettuce and one without. I told the kid in the front ""this sandwich has lettuce one it"" which prompted him to tell the guy and girl at the grill to please fix it... they shrugged their shoulders and pointed at the monitor and said ""well it only says one sandwich no lettuce...""

I mean come on guys. The kid at the register made an honest mistake and instead of going back and forth with him, just fix the dang sand which! Don't sit there and argue. So the guy in the back snatched the sand which and threw it! At that point I asked for a refund.. little did they know, I speak Spanish. So when the assistant manager asked me what happened I explained to her and she let out this LOOOONNGG sigh... so sorry I am an inconvenience to you, but if you were to train your team members some customer service this wouldn't have been an issue. Jesus, the kid at the register was really nice and well mannered. He gets a 5 star. But my experience was just horrible."
15934,3,5 years ago,2 stars,"They seemed overwhelmed at lunch in Drive thru. Very slow. Then when at window was asked to pull forward when simply ordering a number 2 with nothing special added? Seriously, a quarter pounder takes extra time to make? Now I remember why I dislike McDonalds."
15935,3,4 years ago,3 stars,Don't use the app & have your husband pick up unless he takes your device because they won't give you the food you've ordered AND paid for!! Never had a problem at this store until now. THUMBS DOWN ON THE MCDS APP AND MANAGEMENT!!!
15936,3,3 years ago,3 stars,It's McDonald's.  Double drive thru. Good service.  McDonald's menu. Nice triple window different way to service when busy seems to speed things up. So if your racing 114 to work. Its a block through the parking lot or South down 377 (mess in traffic) if heavy use the parking lot entrance to the same menu you see coast to coast and around the globe.
15937,3,3 years ago,1 star,"I come here every morning for breakfast on my way to work. Ever since they got the ""Angry Bird eyebrows chick"" workin the drive through my order is always wrong. Not a little wrong like very wrong! Today was a simple order of a Coke and a sausage biscuit with strawberry jam. But she trys to give me a Frappuccino. Then after I clarify what I ordered again I get a Dr pepper instead of a Coke and then grape instead of strawberry. This is a everyday occurrence when she is working the drive-thru window. I even have talked to the shift manger and he laughed it off. I cant wait for the new Mc Ds to open on 114 and 35!!"
15938,3,5 years ago,5 stars,"I wouldn't normally write a review, especially for a McDonalds that I go to often, but recently I have been going through the drive through and have seen a man that has twice as much enthusiasm as anybody else working there.

15941,3,a year ago,1 star,Absolute worst service. The manager has no control over her employees. Absolutely rude and unprofessional.
15942,3,5 years ago,1 star,This place is the worst.  It smelled like manure.  I had to go to the counter like 3 times before the order was complete. Cold fries and burnt apple pies. I didnt like this olace at all.  Next birthday for my grandson will be somewhere else.

15945,3,4 years ago,5 stars,The kiddos love to stop by and play in the play places.  This location has a bathroom in the play area which is awesome for the potty training years.  The resturant and play area was very clean and staff was around every so often to check on the cleaniness.  This is one of our favorite locations to visit.
15946,3,2 years ago,4 stars,Classic fast food with addictive french fries. Burgers are prepared and cooked the same across the US. Consistency and quality are worth each visit.
15947,3,5 years ago,1 star,Very disappointed with this McDonald's! I ordered a crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich meal and supersize my order when I drove uo to the window I paid my total and then I sat there waiting for about 5 minutes so I said to myself maybe they're cooking a fresh chicken so I didn't mind the wait. Well when I got home I took the first bite on the sandwich and let me tell you THAT CHICKEN HAD BEEN SEATING ON THE HEAT PAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY HARD LIKE A ROCK AND IT WAS NOT JUICY AT ALL IT WAS VERY DRY! and then the fries that I got were overcooked every single one of them were burnt!
15948,3,9 years ago,1 star,"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I've tried it several times, mostly because it's on the way to my work...but after today, honestly, I'd rather skip breakfast all together. I got a completely soggy hash brown, soggy all the way around. I got a small caramel frappe with a shot of espresso. They put the espresso on the bottom and just poured the Frappe on top, so all I got was espresso when I first tried it. To add insult to injury, they put it in a small cup and dumped the rest out (it should have been in a medium cup). I worked at a McDonald's for over 2 years and this one does not follow procedures at all"
15949,3,4 years ago,4 stars,Always enjoy this McDonald's and I am not a fan of the food. The food is hot and correct majority of the time. The play area is great and staff is friendly. Keep up the good work.

15953,3,5 years ago,1 star,"I used to go to this McDonald's every morning for breakfast. The customer service has gone to hell and they haven't gotten my order correct in the drive thru for 8 days in a row. No one speaks English well enough to complain, they just look at you and smile."
15954,3,5 years ago,1 star,"This McDonald's screws up 96% of the time! Tonight was the last straw. My husband ordered 2 large fries, 2 PLAIN McChickens, and 2 large drinks.....The drinks were great.....the rest was not even what he ordered and OLD. In the bag was a fillet o fish (which to my surprise was the only fresh thing), 2 medium 5 year old fries, and 2- 10 year old cheeseburgers...seriously, the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting. Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it. Way to go McDonald's for providing POOR SERVICE yet again."

I get home only to discover that the hamburgers did not have ketchup and onions, but were instead covered in mustard.  Won't be back."

While waiting, some filthy guy was exchanging $80 in singles for twenties. After he got done with his banking transaction, he actually spun around and walked right into me- talk about the bum rush!!
The true danger here, though, is when you try to enter. There is a welcome sign at the curb directing cars to enter into a single lane driveway where the drive-thru actually exits. A head-on collision waiting to happen.
Stay far away from this place."

I walked in to order with my kids and had to take my order to the car and eat in car which was very uncomfortable with 4 kids bet way better than eating in a place where it was difficult to breath.

16418,28,4 years ago,1 star,"Number of times we've ordered from this McDonalds: 3
Number of times they've gotten the order right: 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer. ""Quarter pounder. Absolutely nothing on it. No cheese. Just the meat and the bun."" It is so simple. Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

I give up. #FightFor15, indeed"

When i got it the bread was old hard like it's been sitting there forever. The nuggets were old. Awful customer service. The majority of staff are pretty much children. There's no type of discipline or order in this place. If you don't like your job just quit it's that simple. But we're paying alot of money for service like this that's just obserred.

Ready to eat, I took a bite, thought nothing of it, I then took another bite and look to see that I bit into a VERY PINK QUARTER POUNDER!!!!! So I grab my food, go to this mcdonald's and show them my burger was pink. They proceed to apologise and gave me a new one, I ask for gloves so I may examine this one. I do and find that this burger is pink as well, so now this is 2 pink burgers in total given to me. I tell them, they go ahead and apologize and gives me another... And yes, you guessed it, a third pink burger!!!!!! So at this point of course I am very much disgusted and appalled by their lack attentiveness of the food they are distributing to the point I ask another customer next to me if he had seen what I did.... I didn't want to feel as if I was picking but he agreed, he saw pink, so I finally asked for a refund and fresh fries and left. I will not support this mcdonald's again!

I'm sorry but I paid a lot for my order to begin with, I'm not excepting burnt fries, especially three days in a row. Each time I asked for some new fries, and then they would give me good fries that were not burnt. Except for yesterday, I got my money back.  I ask the girl why was she giving me burnt fries, and her reply was that they didn't change the oil in which they cooked the fries in. The point is as a customer you don't have to keep excepting burnt fries, or anything that doesn't look right to you. You are already spending so much money to begin with ,to be getting burnt fries. Lately there's been lots of issues with this McDonalds, people have attitudes, don't have manners, they don't even say hi  or thank you for coming. I'll be taking my service elsewhere. No customer service."

16521,28,4 years ago,2 stars,It's my local McDonald's so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the 2nd drive thru lane. But what's the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened tonight. Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of control. Food wise things take a long time usually but it's your normal McDonald's type food except they don't salt their fries well.

16525,28,6 years ago,2 stars,"This McDonald's has always been bottom-of-the-barrel as far back as I can remember, and a sleek face-lift doesn't change the fact that a visit to this McDonald's will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one, so I'll compile a list:
1. Incorrect orders 50% of the time
2. Rude employees and managers
3. Customers who are loud, offensive, and downright violent
4. Poorly made, slapped-together food

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company, P.B.S. Parking Boot Service, and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand $200 cash in exchange for the boot removal. It seems this McDonald's is doing everything to lose business. They thrive off of convenient location alone. Absolutely terrible experience."

I was not aware that this particular Mc Donald's was not a corporate store, honestly I wouldn't know how to differentiate one from the other. In any case to my understanding every Mc Donald's ran the same policy in regards to the food they sell, obviously. So when I go to get my coffee, everyone knows you are entitled for one free refill but to my surprise this Mc Donald's does not honor that. The person at the register who's name is Estella (mexican woman) was the one who took my order and made me feel real uncomfortable and awkward when I asked politely for my refill. There were others on line waiting to take their order and I feel like she deliberately embarrassed me. There was no need to make me feel degraded, at the end of the day I am a customer and I have no need to bring my business here. I should of took my business where I noramlly go which is the one located on Washington Ave, in Belleville. That just goes to show you how true the phrase is, ""Never judge a book by it's cover""!"

I called MULTIPLE times and left multiple messages before I got a call back from a person stating they were the manager. They said they pulled the video and he was just texting no picture. He could be texting my credit card info. I still don't feel comfortable with this and my card is still frozen. Mcdonalds once they take my card is accepting responsibility for any fraud /theft and PCI DSS compliance. If their employee did in fact steal my CC I am filing criminal charges against the employee and McDonalds for not being PCI and PII compliant. The auditor in me will not allow this. Even if he truly is innocent, the perception with the influx of cyber crime should never happen. Do not have your cell phone out when holding someone's credit card."

When my order came out, no one informed us there was no sauce , didnt ask us when making it if we still wanted it , another sandwich or my money back ..
I told them I heard them and they denied it , then said that they told someone else to let me know there was missing items for the sandwich . But she didnt , (I could hear them) and why would she make it without confirmation if she DID tell someone to ask ??
I also noticed there was 2 tomatoes instead of 3 that i paid extra for, same goes for the pickles I asked extra for .
I got a male employees attention and told him , hey this isn't correct...etc. he hot an attitude , rolled his eyes turned his back on me to continue what he was doing previously .
The only saving grace was a lady named Elyce , someone who I thought was a manager but she is only a crew member.

Customer service is pitiful the employees are rude and by the way they take your order I don't think they like what they are doing. Also need more manpower too many customers and a very long wait time. And then you get you order now it has to be to go and it does not come with catsup for the fries, 2 napkins fires half way full etc etc. I will think twice before I go back to that restaurant. I really like McDonald's but having those experiences I might stop eating big mac's, fish sandwich, fries, sweet rolls and many other things.

17196,17,2 years ago,1 star,They need to hire real English speakers. It took me 10+ minutes to explain my order. Then my fries were so cold they must have prepared them last night. I had to go back inside and wait another 10 minutes to get them replaced. Meanwhile my burgers were getting cold. There were 2 Mexicans ladies working the front and drive thru who seamed to be conversing and unbothered by THE customers in the lobby. The Mexican man in the back was the only one working hard. I don't know if anyone else was English speakers or not but all I saw was 4-5 Mexicans working at noon. Photos included. Management or owners need to periodically check to see if their restaurant is to standards.

Meanwhile the untrained cashier cannot prioritize drink expediting. When one of the white customers asked the manager to assist, the manager just looked at him and turned around. In response, that white customer left very angry before ordering. After witnessing this obvious display of racism towards whites, another white couple simply walked out without ordering. Finally I ordered my meal. A Big Mac meal. It took five minutes to expedite my meal. The black manager yelled out my number, dropped the bag that contained my meal on the counter and turned and left. No thank you, no reassurance that I was pleased, nothing.

You tell them the situation and they look at you like it's your fault and dont even apologize for any inconvenience they have caused you.

17201,17,2 years ago,1 star,"It's unfortunate that after today,  I'll be going to the McDonald's on Beach. 3yrs here, 7 days a week I order a large mocha.   I've seen the management change about 7 people and I've made some friends.
All those people are gone. I made a direct complaint recently because I've had enough,  you'd think I'd go to a different McDonald's with ""that ""many issues right? Well, I don't think I should have had to drive further for their lack of customer service, but...its not changing. My complaint was handled fast and efficient. I come to retrieve my mocha and it tasted weird, a couple of days ago. I came back and was asked to park in 3 for it to be re made. I then gave it back to the lady and told her to please let the manager know I wasn't satisfied with the drink, we both laughed and she said ok.
Yesterday, I waited an hr because it was raining crazy...for a doordash. They gave the wrong item first and I had to reorder.
Today I go, and retrieve my mocha again, and the manager ask me how many were promised to me? I let her know,  the last one I came back and returned and told the girl somethings wrong with it,  it's taste burnt.  The gm says , I saw you yesterday and I know I gave you a free mocha. To me...that is calling me a liar. Especially when you repeat it after I tell you ,I didn't come yesterday,  I doordashed and yall messed that up. I also have dash receipts to show.
She then says I didn't call you a liar, but I know I gave you a free one. She then tells me her staff shared that I drive up without ordering. No. Have you ever experienced that? I'm here daily! When I told her her staff isn't at the window, just as she wasn't when I pulled up*today*  she said something was wrong with the speaker...No, accept some accountability.  The last manager told me she was Rosa and that's not the same lady I complained on. Anywho,  I told her I'm not the problem and I'm not sure why this hasn't been fixed yet,  but today I've decided to switch locations. lol drive further for good customer service, Rosa, thank you for at least responding today.

17202,17,2 years ago,2 stars,Very slooowww service. Just about any time I show. They send you to the waiting spot # 2 for 10 minutes for 2 chicken nuggets happy meals and 2 chicken sandwich. This happens often. I will go to a different McDonald's.
17203,17,2 years ago,1 star,"This particular location is by far starting to be the worst in alliance! Their fries are always cold they sweet tea is nasty and the burgers are ""warm"" last week was our last time going to this location. We've found a better one"
17204,17,2 years ago,1 star,Management is  rude  went in to order some food young lady a register was taking my order when the manager comes over a tries to hand me a mask. When informed that i have a condition the keeps me from wearing one she rudely informed me  they would have to void my order and cant serve  me.  So loving that i can't  get food without  a mask and i drive a truck.
17205,17,3 years ago,2 stars,Same reason as before there was a rubberband in my food rapper and dirt on my bun
17206,17,2 years ago,1 star,"I just went here 20 minutes ago it took very long i never got my receipt, ordered 40 chicken nuggets and didn't give me any sauces after specifying I wanted ranch buffalo and bbq when i asked her for sauce she handed me 4! Not only that she didn't hand me my money right and made my $5 dollar bill drop on the ground she was a young Lady with orangy yellow hair. Each Night is the same. This mcdonalds has horrible workers and horrible customer service!"

17208,17,2 years ago,1 star,"The lady who took my order was on her phone. She missed my order. Had to order again to the manager and he was speaking rude. The lady who gave me the remaining order literally threw it onto the table, rolled her eyes over. Not a good experience."
17209,17,2 years ago,2 stars,"042321 Tried them again in a rush and was insulted with a terrible attitude because I added a tea to my order, then she walked away with my credit card, the large cup had black finger prints marks on it, and gave me a scorched and cold egg Mcmuffin sandwich. The hashbrown was also greasy!

I ordered a bacon McGriddle w/o cheese, hash brown and a senior coffee. She thanked me and stated my cost. When it wasn't aligned with normal cost, I had to ask if I would do better ordering it as a meal. That reduced the price very nicely, but made me wonder why my server didn't at least offer to check the price to help me. Then, I decided if I'm paying for my cheese, I'll take it on the side. When I got my order, the bacon and the hash brown were just so loaded with grease! The sandwich was messier, sweet dough (yuk) and the hash brown soaked through the bag! I know McDonald's serves fast food, but this made me feel like a heart attack was going to happen if I ate it! I rarely stop at McD but I was running and hadn't eaten. The experience reminded me, they are not emergency food, they are emergency room food."
17210,17,6 years ago,1 star,"Poor service. They were super busy and took the orders pretty fast, but they didn't make my order. I waited 15 minutes for 6 nuggets and a small fry. After several other orders that were placed after me were served I asked about mine and the lady handing out orders  just brushed me off. I just asked for a refund instead, which was a lot quicker. Thanks for wasting my time. Ronald wouldn't not be happy, not happy at all!"
17211,17,4 years ago,1 star,"The manager himself throws fries inside the to go bag, maybe 10 in the container and the rest all loose in the bag. Has a salty attitude and highly unqualified position. Not a good front for this business. Recommend new management, do the manager a favor and get rid of him. I can only imagine how the food is prepared.

PS. The chicken nuggets taste like out-dated breaded shrimp."
17212,17,4 years ago,1 star,I ordered a bacon smokehouse meal. The lady asked chicken or patty. No where on menu did it say chicken. The only thing I received correct with my order was the drink. I ordered beef and I received the chicken only. I ordered the meal and didn't receive my fries. Then the receipt said sandwich only with chicken. Usually when you order its automatically a meal unless specified otherwise. I ordered the meal she heard everything I said cause she repeated it back to me. I will make my stops elsewhere.
17213,17,4 years ago,1 star,"I am only giving 1 star instead of 0 because the OTHER staff were great. I listened to the manager verbally abuse the staff & customers. The establishment was a disaster, including a gentleman with no shoes picking at his toes in the back booth. I feel sorry for anyone having to work under this manager. Even when he managed the courtesy to pull a employee to the back to ""speak"" to them, everyone was still able to hear the highly explosive conversation. l do however commend the other staff for holding it together although i did see one staff member crying while taking orders after a ""conversation"" with said manager. I pray UPPER MANAGEMENT reads this review and does something about this situation ASAP. This is the worst review i have ever had to write and hope to never have to write such a review again."
17214,17,a year ago,5 stars,Best Macdonalds ever. They have nice ladies and they're open 24 7. They are connected to the pilot truck stop. They also have a drive thru on the west side of the building.
17215,17,3 years ago,4 stars,This was a convenient place to stop and grab something to eat on our way home from a movie. They were busy and I was thinking it would take a while but they had employees who knew what they were doing. And we were able to get our order within 5 minutes and they got it right.
17216,17,2 years ago,1 star,The self check out are down and apparently they dont serve lunch till 1100 on Saturday. This whole experience even with the pilot that shares its location was bad. I did call ahead but i got no answer from the pilot. Their showers and laundry is down they're doin construction but the truck parking lot is kinda tight. If a mom and poped open a truck stop around here id give them business. Also this mcdomalds doesnt have indoor dine in due to covid. If you want to be comfortable and sit in a restaurant and eat come to my home state of fl amd get real southern hospitality. We dont live in fear in fl. I didnt think texas had well i leave it at that. They could at least clean the sitting area even though it has caution tape and looms like a crime scene. A little broom and a mop would make a world of difference but the dust that has accumulated out yhere could give a person a cold. Companies really need to start rethinking this covid kick. With resent events people are going to become more conservative with their money. Oils is about to go up and energy pretty muck controls the market. Might be a good time for companies to become more hospitable

17220,17,2 years ago,4 stars,"Not bad service. They were fast, not super friendly but not mean. The food they served me was actually pretty well done. They did give me the wrong sauce I asked for though."
17221,17,5 years ago,1 star,"Sign inside says.""now hiring smiling faces"".  That's good because none of staff was smiling at all.  My Egg McMuffin was burned around edges.  .  We got sweet tea instead of regular tea.  Didn't ask about sauce, just put in hot sauce.  Would be nice to get a thank you too.  Definitely not a place I would recommend or stop at again."
17222,17,3 years ago,5 stars,"I was very impressed with the attitude of Mr. Vincent, Miss Lexy and Miss Jordan.

17226,17,2 years ago,1 star,All Mondays were supposed to be free coffee for the month of December only for school employees. I didn't know that school employees go to truck stops to get coffee. I thought that were more of Star Bucks coffee drinkers. Very disappointed in Mc Donald's again.
17227,17,2 years ago,1 star,"This location NEVER gets the order out the window correctly. I was shorted  half of my order AGAIN!!! DO NOT ORDER FOOD HERE!!!! I'm so sick of this, a refund doesn't mitigate the issue!! TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE ORDER AND MAKE DARN SURE THAT THE FOOD IS ALL THERE!! Y'all are providing a service, we pay you to get it right. Over and over I've had to make the delivery person do YOUR job. And guess what? Something is ALWAYS MISSING. usually an entire bag. Tonight, there are no fries. NONE. On a $40 order!!! Ridiculous. If I could give y'all no stars I would."
17228,17,3 years ago,1 star,"It's a shame that I have to rate Mcdonalds a 1 star, but the service I received tonight was by far the worst I have experience and it needs to be addressed because now I will not be going back but the young lady that was working drive thru tonight her name is Elise was very rude and can not believe the way she talks to customers this is how exactly it went word for word and I work in customer service so I know how customers can be over the top when there complaining but word for word this is how it was, I honked my horn as I was in drive thru after I received my food because I had asked for ranch sauce and was given buffalo, keep in mind this is not a big deal for me and I will not be rude to the young lady over this but she took my honk as i did not have manners which is by far not my intentions I was simply trying to get her attention. She opened the window and asked me with a attitude Did you just honk? And started going off on me about manners, by then i was so upset that i just told her just hand me my ranch i will not argue with you as she still was holding the ranch still going off I then told her are you kidding me just give me the ranch and explained to her since I pulled up to this window you have had a rude attitude but that was not my place to get upset over that if she was having a bad night I just wanted my order so I can get back to work, as I addressed her attitude she then said to me Why cause I'm black? I was so beyond upset I have never been talk to this way from any restaurant and really do not know what this girls deal was and how did it lead to her assuming it was about her being black. Will not be going back."
17229,17,4 years ago,1 star,I did an mobile online service and for the first and the drive thru person was so rude and didn't ask me for my order number but said my name. I pulled up to the window and waited for  my food and the drive thru person end up asking what my order was I am like are you serious and so I told him and was so mad cause I went to this location before and always had nice people but today and for now on I will not return to  this location because ever again. One bad experience makes you not want to come back. Even the manager sounded rude too.
17230,17,4 years ago,1 star,"I stop here often only because it is on my way to and from work, but seriously this is by far consistently the worst McDonalds I have ever visited.  The milk shake machine is always broke down, as was tne case today.  I ordered a big mack, hold the catchup, fries and a diet coke. I even repeated myself to hold the catsup twice at the microphone and asked at the window again to insure she understood to hold the catsup on the burger and was meet with a very curt ""yes, I heard you"". Guess what , not only did they not hold the catsup but it was over loaded with extra catsup and I got a regular coke.  Well at least the fries were right.  I honestly believe the main problem is that the people taking orders at the drive thru speak poor English and obviously understand it equally as poorly, toped off with very poor customer service skills.  They s eriously act like the customers are a bother."
17231,17,2 years ago,1 star,"I dont eat breakfast without mac sauce, they have given me mac sauce with my breakfast before but now they won't, so no breakfast for me. Lost a sale because their to lazy to open up some mac sauce... just wows me."
17232,17,5 years ago,1 star,"After waiting five minutes in a drive through line the vehicle at the ordering microphone had to jump the curb to exit the line because the drive through lane was blocked by another car at the pickup window. When I pulled up to the order microphone I was greeted with ""pleas wait a second."" I replied, ""i've been reading the newspaper for the past five minutes and you are telling me to wait a second."" He said the computers were down and that they were accepting cash only. If they had any integrity for customer service they would have come out and told us that five minutes ago. I also had to jump the curb to leave the line. When I did, I was met with yelling from a person in the parking lot."
17233,17,5 years ago,1 star,"They used to have average customer service and take forever in the drive thru. Now the customer service is also bad. The lady at the drive thru can not get my order right for the life of her and is just rude. I mean it's convenient for me as it's on my way to work but if you can avoid it, do yourself a favor!"
17234,17,5 years ago,1 star,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. ! !
This is the worst MacDonalds that I ever visited.
-Worker with cold touxhing her nose several times, and then handling food.
-Bad customer service...worker at cash register treating customer's with a reallt bad attitude.
-Morning shift manager seems that she don't care about customer complaints.
-Management and front staff need to be fired."
17235,17,3 years ago,4 stars,"Ok here complaint. You serve breakfast bisque bacon egg and cheese. But you don't serve bacon egg and cheese bagels after 12pm.
I find that unacceptable it's on your menu and you are a business that is seeking to make a buck. You seek to have positive numbers on your income. So why it is such big deal that you can't serve me a bagel after 12pm? I'm the customer and put money in your pocket. You need to rethink your way of treatment of your customers. I can buy anything on your menu at anytime."
17236,17,4 years ago,3 stars,The service was extremely poor as many customers had to wait a while for their food. The only reason I even gave it 3 stars was because the manager stepped in and took care of the customers. The food was good and fresh.
17237,17,a year ago,1 star,Oh gross dont ever eat hear now they are all dope heads here took 30 min to get my order that only consisted of 2 small fries and 2 cheese burgers

17239,17,3 years ago,1 star,The whole time the worker was taking my order I felt rushed. she was rushing me. when I got home and checked my bag two barbecue sauces showed up on the screen when I was ordering but when I got home I was disappointed to see no sauces were in the bag.

17245,17,4 years ago,1 star,The cashier ignored me 4/2 minutes and then finally whenever I asked if they were going to take my order she rolled her eyes and took my order and then I'm not sure if they just forgot to make my order or accidentally handed it out the window but after about 20 minutes I asked where my order was and none of the employees had any idea. I had to repeat what I had ordered about three different times and then about ten minutes later I got my food. I was on a lunch break at work a my entire brake was spent being ignored and waiting on food to be remade. I will never visit this status men again.
17246,17,4 years ago,1 star,Came to this McD this morning. No my usual spot. Lol. Asked for water no ice got ice water.  Side of gravy. Gravy is spoiled. Asked for 4 splenda. Got 2.  Did not get hot cakes and there was a busted syrup in the bag with the splenda and gravy on its side. There was a manager at the window.  I always say please and thank you to everyone. I know it is busy but it only takes a second to listen to someone you are serving.  Chick-fil-a is always busy but you don't get this stuff there.

17248,17,3 years ago,1 star,This restaurant really needs to get on board with keto or low carb burgers. I asked for a quarter pounder with cheese and bacon wrapped in lettuce.

17258,17,7 years ago,1 star,"The manager at night is awful very unprofessional and is extremely rude.
She yelled at me a couple of months ago because i asked for a plain mcdouble and said just ketchup cheese and meat and she gor super rude yelled back at me about how she clearly knows what plain is and that i dont need to explain it to her. I continued to go there because she wasnt always there and now shes the only person who works the window at night i drive by to see if shes who is working and if she is i refuse to go at all because shes rude to me every time i go.

As long as your expectations aren't too high, the food is okay, just sad though what Micky D's and Burger King and the others have done to the Great American Hamburger. If you look around you can get better food and service. The only burgers worse than Micky Ds are the soy burgers you get out of vending machines. And as long as you don't ask for anything special, they'll make you a burger, but I asked for one without onions and catsup, and naturally they couldn't even get that right. A crappy burger with crappy service, what a wonderful meal.. BTW, if you want to find The Great American Hamburger, as it should be, go to Fuddruckers."

17689,38,a year ago,1 star,"Stop here only if you're desperate.  We came by late, and hardly anyone was in the restaurant, yet they were still extremely slow.  We waited about 30 minutes for 6 orders.  You order on screens instead of with a person, and the system still feels like it's in a beta mode.  On the bright side, you can get booze next door while you wait."

All of that wouldn't be so bad but when I called for a refund I was lied to by the manager that they called my order, which they did not. I stood inside for 15 minutes watching the counter to see if they had my order. So they lied and kept my money."
17696,38,a week ago,1 star,"PLEASE CHECK YOUR TO GO ORDERS BEFORE YOU LEAVE!! I would give negative stars, if I could. I ordered a to go order, but ended up staying to eat in the dining room.  I opened my quarter pounder hamburger and it was turned upside down with all of the toppings splattered onto the box as if it was slapped in there. It literally had no top hamburger bun, and when I brought this up to the cashier she said that this is what a ""quarter hamburger"" was. When I asked for just a top hamburger bun at least and showed the cashier the burger she didn't even apologize or offer to remake the burger she just snatched the box out of my hands. I paid for this burger and was only asking for the bun, not making a scene or demanding anything or being rude. I had chosen to not acknowledge the mess it was because there are enough verbally abusive patrons. But all the cashier ended up doing was turn the burger right side up (no gloves) and slap an undercooked bun on it, and yell at the other adult woman at the grill about ""what's missing here?"". It wasn't even busy in the drive thru or the dining room. I can't pretend to know their job or lives, but I hope they aren't this effed up to every PAYING customer. I ended up asking for a refund, and not taking the burger, even this was an issue. Please beware!! I only regret not getting their names to report them. Again, not trying to be  a drama queen but I worked hard to afford this little splurge to get this slap in the face."

And their fries were hot, fresh, crisp, & salty , just the way I like them. Fyi-there's limited parking in front facing LV Boulevard but in the back there are a lot of spaces."
17698,38,2 weeks ago,1 star,I ordered an egg muffin at 5:30 AM.  I was expecting a fresh one.  The bread was overly chewy so for some reason I opened it up and looked inside.   There were dark clumps of matter in which I can only presume was dead chicken fetus.

The person at the drive-through window is having to go back and forth to take orders inside as well.   The self-serve soda fountain machines are turned off, so I have to wait until the drive-through guy eventually makes his way to the inside counter to get a re-fill.  I have never seen a fast food restaurant so under staffed."

17704,38,2 months ago,4 stars,"Same as any other McDonald's except they were super busy and no one was available to take orders, if you're paying cash, for a while. One of the coffees we ordered had grounds. Food was hot and ok."

17708,38,2 months ago,3 stars,Restaurant was clean. Nothing special run of the mill McDonalds. But if your staying at one of the near by strip hotels it's a reasonable option to get a bite to eat. Plus it has a cool McDonalds sign that sparkles it's very vegas. Liquor store next door kill to birds with one stone.
17709,38,a year ago,2 stars,"The automated kiosks are horrible.
This store is supposed to be fully automated.. but that's probably the reason why it just doesn't work.   McDonalds should really look into the process and solve it. The workers are at the mercy of inferior technology.

I go into McDonalds and am instructed to use the kiosks.

There are some that aren't working.. some that are working.  A customer instructs me not to use the one I'm facing because it's broken.  Instead.. I use the one on the other side.

The process of ordering on the kiosk is slow and cumbersome.  I have a coupon which I wanted to use.  I first add the item.. then scan the coupon.. VOILA... double order.  Okay.. my bad for not understanding the system.  So now I have to remove the item... I add another item.. and it takes me to the cart for some reason and says ""Is this all I want?""

So I add some more things and finalize my order.  I try to check out, but I have no way to edit my order to select to go.  Okay.. no big deal.. I'll just choose a table... and VOILA.. ERROR.. Please see a cashier.

I talk to the McDonalds attendant and he tells me that he could find my order and that I can pay up front.

During this time.. I see and here about 3-4 people sadly yelling at the McDonalds workers for messing up (really.. it's this automated system that doesn't work... not the people.)

McNuggets were okay.  They were warm.. but were on the verge of being dry.
Fries were okay... looked like they were out for awhile.. (and they didn't fill it to the top).
Soda... this was good.

I felt bad for the workers here since it seems the biggest issue is problems with the kiosks and how orders are sent over to workers."

Nothing phenomenal or out of the ordinary to report. Pricing feels amazing compared to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center's (across the street prices) for their food."
17711,38,3 years ago,2 stars,"This Macdonalds fell short on a good quality customer service, their staff was very rude to us and a few other customers on our day of visit, they messed up on our order and we ended up eating 30 mins apart to my wife, I was so disappointed. Place was clean and you had to ask for a key to go into the restrooms, we were in Vegas for vacations and we stayed at mï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ndalay so this was the closest one to us, the 3rd day we wanted Macdonalds again and we decided to drive 15 mins "
17712,38,a week ago,3 stars,On its best day this place is Hella slow!  They should go back to the counter system cuz using the kiosk is the worst!
17713,38,5 months ago,1 star,One of the thing i regret doing is not looking at reviews. Went through the drive thru at 1 am. No one was in line. Food was horrible. Some fries were soaked in grease and were cold stale. Nuggets were way too under cooked it was cold. Find another McD's and only use this if its an absolutely LAST resort to eating!
17714,38,2 months ago,1 star,"Not actually 24hrs. Depends on if the employees want to have the store open. They denied us service and everyone else that pulled in line. Corporate mcdonalds, im sure this isnt the only location like this. Big waste of time."

You guys need to ask for the tickets that helps alot to prevent this kind of mistakes
Also please put a sign if you guys are not droping the food to the table so we know we have to wait for the food at the counter

Very disappointed breakfast"

My simple order had multiple mistakes and there seem to be an almost comical line of people who were missing hash browns from their orders. The entire dining room was disgusting.  Not that it's their fault, but there was a homeless man in front of the store that looked to be on the verge of vomiting and or dying.   This was like 8:00 a.m. on a tuesday, so I assumed they were short staffed if it was that dirty at that hour. One of my two sandwiches and both of my hash browns, once I visually got them, were good."

Once we got the drinks the iced hazelnut latte with less ice was more than an inch empty from the top in a medium and it was so sweet it made me feel nauseous. And when asking to fix it they said that's how it comes and didn't even apologize even though I've had this many times and it's never tasted like this EVER. We also got a Carmel frappe with Oreo topping and an espresso shot; once we got it it didn't have any Oreo or espresso.

17800,38,6 months ago,3 stars,Slow and food 2nd rate compared to other McDonald's
17801,38,3 years ago,3 stars,"I was charged extra for an additional pad of butter and an extra syrup for my pancakes.  They never give enough butter or syrup so I ordered more and was charged more.  That wouldn't be a problem except I didn't get much more.  Then, they didn't fill my cup of orange juice.  It was just a bit more than 3/4 full.  Otherwise, it was very tasty!"

17803,38,a year ago,1 star,"This place is an asylum. If youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re looking one flew meets mad max, this your place. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"

17805,38,a year ago,3 stars,"Not exactly this places fault. Due to measures against covid, only one group of customers are allowed at a time, while ordering inside the building. Otherwise, it's a good McDonald's."
17806,38,2 years ago,1 star,"Two girls at the window were very rude to us and our kids. They asked us to pull around the building but usually if there's no one behind us we say ""we'd like to wait here please"" We know it's all about their timer and restarting it so they say ""look at how fast we got them out""  usually when there's no other car behind us other fast food places say ok but one of the girls at the window kept yelling at us to move. Go to a different one."
17807,38,3 years ago,2 stars,"Not only am I not a big fan of fast food joints but I'm absolutely opposed to filth in any restaurant.
And filth is what I experienced at this McDonald's.
The staff who waited on us was nice, accommodating, and quick, and the food adequate; but the restaurant itself had empty sugar and creamer packs laying everywhere. Reason being, there as no place to throw them away.
So, I am advising you to avoid this McDonald's!"
17808,38,2 years ago,2 stars,"They forgot my apple slices, but still charged me. we literally only ordered 8 hashbrowns 3 soft drinks and my apples... it was not a hard order at all. And I didn't notice till we got back to our hotel, because you know you can't eat indoors or even outside."
17809,38,3 years ago,2 stars,"Quick service. Burgers were barely hot??? A lot of aggressive homeless people in the area. A woman approached my son and I while we were dining inside and asked, ""Would you mind sharing some chicken?"" Nope. Never Again!"
17810,38,4 years ago,5 stars,"We visited this McDonald's around 3 weeks ago just for 2 drinks after visiting the welcome to Vegas sign. I was surprised how clean the place was fresh flowers on the tables, service was quick and friendly even though there was a queue.
Hot a caramel frappuccino and a strawberry milkshake both came beautifully presented.
Can't say a bad thing about this store keep up the good work guys 5* ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"
17811,38,3 years ago,1 star,"Poor and rude customer service!! ""Manager"" needs to work on her customer service skills. She wanted to charge me extra for a medium iced coffee when the phone app deal clearly says ""$0.99 any size coffee premium or iced."" Future customers,  your patience will be tested at this location."
17812,38,4 years ago,5 stars,Who thinks of reviewing a fast food place?  Well if you receive outstanding service from a teenager working hard then the establishment and all the employees deserve a 5-star rating. Not only did the employee flawlessly do his job. He took the time to observe my car while in the drive thru to tell me my tire was going flat. We all know that could have been disastrous had I kept going. Great job!
17813,38,2 years ago,2 stars,"I got a value meal hamburgers were very dry,no condiments on the bun. fries were not cooked all the way still frozen. The Coca-Cola was flat. I don't expect gourmet just a little bit better quality."
17814,38,4 years ago,2 stars,"Not the best experience. Manager was very rude and didn't rectify the situation, which ultimately ended up being a customer service and quality of product issue. She could have easily made it right but failed to do so. I will no longer visit this McDonalds and I urge others to avoid it like the plague. There are plenty of other fast food restaurants in the area that are worth visiting."
17815,38,6 years ago,4 stars,"Lovely staff and amazingly quick service for my big order. Impressive quality and great nuggets with sizzling hot fries. The place is big enough and very clean. However, I noticed the pop machine wasn't working properly and spills cock around which needed a look. Good experience overall."
17816,38,6 months ago,3 stars,"Alot of homeless around the area, probably why they walk you to the bathroom and punch in the code for you."

17818,38,4 years ago,2 stars,"After ordering my food and waiting for over 10 minutes to get it. Coffee was luke warm, I went back to get fresh cup and I was handed a cup that had been sitting on the counter. I told the young lady that it wasn't hot either and she said that it was the normal temperature of their coffee. I finally got her to pour me a fresh hot cup. This is definitely not the place to go to for 'fast food'."
17819,38,2 years ago,1 star,"Cashier I believe name is Mike.  Was made because i order fresh french fries.  So 1st he gave me old cold fries.  When i expressed that i asked for fresh fries and after the supervisor said upgrade me to a large, he brought a small skimpy bag so i asked for the supervisor.  Instead he pour a Ton of salt on the next fries he brought out.  Sad."

We tried to order breakfast and she told us they are not serving breakfast. Granted the menu outside still showed breakfast. She tells us they are only serving lunch. We told her we had been there before 1030. She says sorry I canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t sell breakfast to you and then says we can talk to the manager. Pulled up to talk to the manager she was rude and said they ran out of breakfast. At 1028 we said ok we were at the menu at 1025. She then said I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know what to tell you we ran out of breakfast. Shut the window on us.

17823,38,a year ago,1 star,"Slow, rude, disgusting sticky tables inside the lobby. You'd think you were ordering in a third world country not the Las Vegas strip. Ronald would be disappointed!!"
17824,38,2 years ago,1 star,The dinner room is closed.  The drive thru is open but if you order inside at the counter you must take your food outside and you can eat on the curb surrounded by the homeless.  Even the outdoor seating area is closed off.  What a sad state of affairs.
17825,38,5 years ago,4 stars,A very nice place. You can feel at ease and enjoy quality time with your family and friends.

17827,38,9 months ago,1 star,"no free refill at this Mc Donald, you have to ask the stuff (!!!) - just one refill is possible, restrooms are closed"
17828,38,3 years ago,4 stars,"For 6am, the staff was pleasant, the service was fast, & I even used the self ordering kiosk.l Where it's at, there is no lack of homeless & panhandling, so if you need the restroom, an employee will let you in, and don't be surprised if it is below standards, or seeing someone sleeping at a booth. On a brighter note... The line at the drive-thru window moves swiftly, and there is a bus stop along the sidewalk, for the North bound Las Vegas Strip bus."
17829,38,3 years ago,3 stars,Clearly said I wanted a drink but the cashier did not ring it up. When I asked about my drink they kindly gave me one for free regardless. Great service but normally has a line since it's the south strip spot.
17830,38,3 years ago,5 stars,"So busy we had to wait 30 minutes for our food! Yet I have never seen a more efficient food production line. They were serving numbers already in the 900s when we arrived at 11am! Very clean,  courteous."
17831,38,2 years ago,1 star,"This was one of the worst McDonald's that I've ever been to. I went to the one on Warm Springs and Las Vegas Blvd, the customer service was excellent, they greeted us and made us feel like they cared. We Sked for no onions, we got just that. Our fries were fresh and hot. We wanted more and our tea was watery as we has already started down the Blvd, we went to the next McDonald's that we saw. We ordered fries and a double cheeseburger with no onions. We pulled up to the pay window and asked if we could trade the sweet tea and showed our receipt, the lady told us to ask at the next window, we pay and pull forward. The next person says no we dont do that, I asked for a supv, she explained to me that the other was a franchise and they are corporate. I accepted that. My fries were stale and my burger has onions. I sent them back, they then tasted like they redropped the same fries in the chicken nugget oil. I will never go there again."
17832,38,9 months ago,1 star,"Worst mc Donald's I was ever in employee constantly shouting out numbers to collect food, rude too, only mc Donald's I've been in where that is done"
17833,38,3 years ago,2 stars,Exactly what you'd expect from a McDonald's minus the speed which is disappointing for fast food. We went during what seemed to be rush hour but there was only a skeleton crew on and a single server. We waited for 40 minutes for our food and some of it came cold.. i dont even know how that happens. Definitely not impressed by the service
17834,38,4 years ago,5 stars,"First time at this location.  The drive thru young lady was so sweet and had great communicating skills when she took my order and when she took my payment. The lady at the next window, who gave me my food was very friendly too. Great staff! At first I didn't want to got to a Mcds in the strip but I'm glad I did! Thank you guys!"
17835,38,2 years ago,1 star,"It smelled like a dead body in there. Filthy floors, meth heads laying on the sidewalk outside. The food was vile and disgusting, I threw it out the window within a block and it was still there the next morning. It's pretty bad when racoons and homeless meth heads won't even eat it."
17836,38,2 years ago,1 star,"Don't bother using mobile app. You will wait in line.  Doors locked and no signs telling you lobby closed.  Manager making excuses claiming there is notice, 20+ people count find one.  Needs to be fired for lying .   We visited 4/1 @ 9:55am and parking lot was full of people trying to get into store tugging on doors wondering what is going on."
17837,38,9 years ago,4 stars,"All around the inside is Fair. but need to check air vents its dirty. All Soda Machine need to be constantly  watched because  when its busy it gets nasty and dirty .. floor looks clean but need more cleaning. and the windows all around need to be cleaned, and of course the frame.

Very Impressive One As far as the overall look.

Managers and Staff need to be reminded and or trained that a Franchise who really depends on Customers to have more happy people to come to visit and eat here.

Customer Service is Very Poor. Your Cashier Staff or Front Staff is not following their training. And why is it I walk in and I was stared by your staff and like they don't like to be friendly and all showing , how great and wonderful to have a job ..that lets you interact with people ..This is one of the most questioned part of Hiring. Are a People Person? Are good or happy to be around People. ETC.,

The Outside Area is good , Actually better than good.

Food is very good , but prepared Sloppy on my tray and the way it was wrap and coffee I have to dump some because they fill it to the top. I mean they can save a lot of coffee expense and time making sure ask the customer if they want it fill to the top or not...

So, you have good location ,, ok dining area , staff not satisfied, not customer service oriented plus the Manager is he or she really watching the staff and or helping to correct any discrepancies or problems?

This is THE MC DONALD WHO GENERATE  a lot of the revenue because of its best quality fast food deals and environment ...and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE."
17838,38,3 years ago,1 star,"Poor customer service and  management.

17839,38,4 years ago,3 stars,This McDonald's is okay is located right next to Harrah's Casino convenient but the sweet tea was not really that sweet they don't really do bundle deals I'm from the south. I had to wait over 20 minutes for my 20 piece and another lady next to me was waiting on hers it wasn't the cashier's fault but her back crew never drop them but overall I like the McDonald's like I said it's okay
17840,38,a year ago,1 star,This place completely ignores the folks that come inside. They will focus on the Drive thru and that's it. Don't expect much from Macdonalds to start with but this REALLY lowered the bar
17841,38,2 years ago,4 stars,"As McDonald's goes it was that. However the food genuinely looked like the picture. It was clearly made to order. Wish I could've used the restrooms. I guess they didn't know that you can block off every other sink, urinal, stall or whatever. It was the last free standing McDonald's with parking southbound from Vegas. Bottom of Vegas Blvd."
17842,38,3 years ago,1 star,"The lady in front of me had a coupon for an ice coffee or something and the order taker thought it was for a regular coffee. So the manager comes over and tells the lady she needs to pay an extra dollar to get the ice coffee  The lady customer then shows her the coupon which must have made the manager mad because she sternly tells the order taker to give her her ice coffee .

Then she rudely tells everyone in line to go use the kiosk  that they'll no longer take orders the normal way.
I'd already stood in line almost 10 minutes and was next but that didn't matter.

Ever since they changed this McDonald's around a couple of months ago and got new management the service, to me, has been terrible, which really sucks because for over 2 years now this is where I mostly take my breaks.
After tonight I will no longer buy food from the McDonald's on the Strip at four seasons."
17843,38,2 years ago,1 star,Longest line. Taking one car order and pick up at a time and the people are so irritating. Ask for an original ice coffee like it says on the menu and they said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ahh whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s that.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿

17848,38,3 years ago,5 stars,McDonalds is always our go to place. Your welcomed by friendly staff. You know what your getting before venturing in. They offer everything from standard to a healthy menu. I like how they are more modern in there decor. McDonalds stands behind the quality and standards of there food.

Can't beat $30 total that includes ice cream. I think I paid $25 for a single Margarita daiquiri poolside.  It was clean, service was prompt and it wasn't too crowded.  You get what you expect at McDonald's and that's all you're asking for.  Cheap fast good tasting food.  So if you're staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel and you're looking for something cheap take the 5 minute walk and head over to McDonald's.  You will only feel a little guilty."
17877,38,2 years ago,1 star,I've been in places in 3rd world countries cleaner than this. But I will say the food taste normal. If your at Mandalay bay and nothing else is open it's an option but I wont go hear again. Hopefully I dont get hepatitis.

17887,38,4 years ago,4 stars,"Food , service and price was great,  gave 4 stars because you have to go to the register and get a pin code to get in the restroom,. I didn't have time to wait in line to get the code. Other then that everyone was very mice and great service"
17888,38,a year ago,1 star,Service sucked old people shouldn't be directed to a computer to place there order evey thing doesn't have to be automated does it older Americans made Micky D's what is today so show some respect my money is green and so is my debit card bye have a nice day ps what ever happened to service with a smile
17889,38,4 years ago,5 stars,I was looking for some cheap food and found this within walking distance of the end of the strip. Not crazy busy and pretty clean. The service is pretty quick and clean restrooms. The prices arenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï
17890,38,3 years ago,1 star,"The widow attendant didn't greet us or make eye contact, simply gave me the amount due. She gave us our order and didn't say bye or thank you. The worst part of all was that it was the manager or one of the managers. Thursday night,  approximately 10pm."
17891,38,2 years ago,3 stars,"3 stars because the location looks rundown. Also, they only gave us 1 napkin for everything we ordered. Other customers were complaining about the same thing."
17892,38,a year ago,2 stars,"Prices are too high just because they're on the Strip you don't have to double your prices personally I think it's ridiculous why rip everyone off , just cuz you're on the Strip , yeah I know rent is more expensive , But you get so much more traffic so many more customers. It goes hand-in-hand"
17893,38,5 years ago,1 star,The asian lady tried her best but ahe has very poor staff that provide horrible service. The big tall black lady cut me off while I was ordering at the window and made me come inside and the white girl with purple hair rolled her eyes at every customer who came in contact with her. The place was filthy. My chicken sandwich has a hole in it! Not a good place to eat. Do not eat here!
17894,38,5 months ago,5 stars,81584 for the potty room love ya
17895,38,2 years ago,3 stars,We used the drive thru to get coffee...they don't sell decaf?! At all....ever?! Strange...I can't have caffeine so I was out of luck and had to stop at a gas station.
17896,38,8 months ago,1 star,"Your trash employees have the store closed at 4pm in the afternoon.

Fire the afternoon crew for today"
17897,38,5 years ago,4 stars,Priced for thr Strip... The Manager needs to not yell at the employees in front of the customers. Wow... Nice ladies who work there. Have some respect from management. Went around 11:30 am on Friday.
17898,38,4 years ago,4 stars,"It was McDonald's. You know what you're going there for and it is always quick and acceptable.

If you are expecting a linen table cloth and candles you are in the wrong place. If you are expecting quality food at a good price and rapidly - you found McDonald's!"
17899,38,5 years ago,1 star,The big 0 rating . People are very rude and my uber eats order was not even placed. Waiting 15 minutes already and still waiting. I truly wish I could post pics here because the store is FILTHY AND YES I TOOK PICS FOR DIRTY DINING. EVERY TIME I COME IN HERE IT'S GROSS .
17900,38,2 years ago,2 stars,There was not a long wait in the drive thru but the food was cold and stale.   Fries un salted and cold fish sandwich was dry and sad.   Will not be going back
17901,38,2 years ago,2 stars,Very long wait for food.. coffee not made the usual way. Cashier did his best to be courteous but without correct leadership that is best we will get!
17902,38,4 years ago,4 stars,"Standard McDonald's food except I notice they give half the bacon that other McDonalds I've been to, with hotcakes. It's a convenient walk from Mandalay Bay when you're just tired of spending a ton of money and waiting in line for a mediocre breakfast at the hotel.

The ice coffee is very weak so stick to hot coffee if you need the caffeine boost.

The bathrooms are locked so you'll have to ask for a key."
17903,38,3 years ago,5 stars,"For a McDonald's... this was the best experience I've had and the food was fresh, fast, not sloppy, accurate, staff was awesome. I mean it's fast food and a McDonald's of all things but... It was good enough I had to review it."
17904,38,a year ago,5 stars,Not everything is overpriced in Las Vegas. Sometimes there is nothing better than a McDonald's. You know what you get and how much it is going to cost
17905,38,5 years ago,4 stars,This McDonalds location is okay. The food is always tastes great! I like how they have WiFi here. So I was able to eat and get my work done. The staff here are nice! I like this environment and commend this place.
17906,38,2 years ago,1 star,It's been a long time since I have received the attitude I did when I asked for the coke I had ordered but did not receive. Hopefully this is not a regular example of behavior for this location.
17907,38,2 years ago,5 stars,"Fast service, online order pickup was prompt and ready to go upon arrival. Open late [early] and walking distance from Mandalay Bay. Only restaurant open besides Subway during twilight hours in the area."
17908,38,a year ago,1 star,Manager Vanessa was the rudest person I have ever met. She was cursing at customers. This place needs new management.  Very disrespectful.
17909,38,a year ago,3 stars,"Everything was good except kiosk ordering.  Must use credit card, and if you have not used there kiosks it is a bit confusing."
17910,38,4 years ago,3 stars,"Kinda dirty, kinda sketchy, there was a homeless guy shouting at random people about the crimes hes committed. The only savings grace was the secuirty guard threatening the push him into traffic if he came back on the property. Haha! If nothing less, it was entertaining!"
17911,38,10 months ago,1 star,Pricing is wrong and people will bud you and they serve them without issue. Brutal location.
17912,38,5 years ago,4 stars,This McDonalds is like home and has a good down to earth vibe. I would of gave five stars but the hang ups I have is the homeless people in the drive thru constantly begging. Its just getting really annoying. Like I wanna order my food and eat without being bothered. I hope the get a little more mindful of that. Also many times I order something and they often forget to put everything I'm the bag. I know this mcdonalds gets a lot of traffic and is busy but those are the only pickles I have.
17913,38,2 years ago,2 stars,It was late at night so I was happy to see they we still open. But the food was made terrible very sloppy and had a bad smell to it. So I was unsatisfied.
17914,38,a year ago,1 star,"It's simple. Website says open 24 hours, yet they're closed at 4am on a Saturday night with workers inside. Unacceptable."
17915,38,4 years ago,1 star,"""Open 24 hours"" we got here at 2.30 am and they say it's not open until 3.30 am. Finally they open at 3.40 am but they wouldn't accept cards, only cash. Then the girl at the cashier, Heidi she said, was attending the register and then going to the kitchen, no gloves, touching the food, so rude and so loud, terrible service here today."
17916,38,a year ago,1 star,Sad that they only had three employees. God bless them and shame the way McDonald's treats employees. This is a Corporate owned not a franchise. Bad ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï
17917,38,7 months ago,4 stars,"Very busy
Staff were ok.
Didn't have lemon for my tea"
17918,38,3 years ago,2 stars,Could be because the place was under construction but the service was ridiculously slow: we spent at least 5 minutes at the second window. The lady tried to keep two of our drinks and there was no napkins in the bag.
17919,38,6 years ago,4 stars,"I eat here for lunch a lot and I've never seen a ton of homeless people here. I see one once in a while outside, but that's it. Food is served fast and fries are hot! I love it here."
17920,38,3 years ago,2 stars,"Bathrooms are locked in a way that only a manager can open them.  Then, there's no hand soap or toilet paper.  Took FOREVER to get us our food.  Just sub-satandard...even by McDonalds standards!"
17921,38,3 years ago,3 stars,What you'd expect from a busy McDonalds in Vegas.  Decent food.  Decent speed.  Good service.  Only reason for three stars was the weird guy in a bowtie.  Are you a McDonalds greeter? Is that a thing? Either way nobody going to McDonald's wants to be bothered.  We go out to eat and sit down to be bothered.
17922,38,4 years ago,4 stars,Nice service by the employees very satisfactory. Some of the people seemed to not have to go anywhere. Taking up places to sit for families but quick and pleasant.
17923,38,a year ago,1 star,Service sucks ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ unable to provide my order before 45 minutes of waiting. Then received the
17924,38,8 months ago,5 stars,Busy but has lots of kiosks to speed up the process.
17925,38,a year ago,1 star,This place sucks. Customer service is awful. We stood in line at the drive-thru for 20 minutes and they never took our order.
17926,38,4 years ago,5 stars,Service support for drive-thru  was excellent! I asked for fresh food (Chicken nugget combo with large half cut Ice tea). It was worth the wait.  Thank you
17927,38,5 years ago,1 star,"Every McDonalds on the planet has the two sausage mcmuffin with egg for $3.33 special except for these guys. The lady taking the order says ""we don't have specials - there's too many tourists."" After getting a manager to translate ""can I have a receipt please"" to the cashier that spoke zero english, I took my overpriced food and split. The one positive is the three bums fighting in the parking lot did provide for some entertainment while I waited."
17928,38,10 months ago,1 star,"Best to look for other stores, coz this one won't deliver your order ever"
17929,38,a year ago,1 star,They no respect the prices for example the breakfast promotion 2 sauce McMuffin for $4.50 they want pay $8.45
17930,38,5 months ago,1 star,"Not open 24hrs, 2am closed already"
17931,38,2 years ago,5 stars,"Quick drive through. A little tight parking lot in the front of the restaurant, but additional parking in back. Conveniently close to Mandalay Bay, Luxor, etc. on east side of Las Vegas Blvd."
17932,38,3 years ago,4 stars,"Got the big breakfast and it really hit the spot.
Didn't like it that the employee wasn't all that helpful about their menu availability at 430 am.
But the breakfast was good."
17933,38,4 years ago,1 star,"$3.88 for two large cokes?  You can go eff yourselves.  The McDonalds down the street charges $1.08 each.  Or, I can stop at Circle K on my way home from the Strip and get a Polar Pop 44oz for .79 cents plus tax."
17934,38,2 years ago,1 star,Can't get a refill because of Covid?  All you have to do is use a new cup.  I think at a $1.79 per drink one cup won't cut into the profit margin that much.  But I wouldn't want to send McDonald's into bankruptcy.  Quit being cheap and hiding behind Covid for an excuse.
17935,38,9 months ago,1 star,I work the midnight hours down the street. Stopped by at 0130 and the place was closed. Not a 24 hour operation.
17936,38,a year ago,4 stars,Ordered inside to go. It was very busy. Took 20 minutes to get my order.
17937,38,4 years ago,2 stars,"Mcds is expensive for the type of food and how they treat the employees. I ordered sausage McMuffin, hash brown, LG c9ffee 7.00$$$ my total is 1.19, 1.45, 1.60 plus 8.25 tax under 5.00. I'm sorry but mcds make billions per day and steals even more. Going 2 manager .Seriously people needs 2 be more aware what companies are doing. You say it's only 2.00 but it happens all the time. And the companies is the only one who benefits. Just saying. Sad!!!!ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï"

17939,38,a year ago,1 star,If McDonald's were a raccoon who served you garbage you'd be in a better spot. Good luck humanity.
17940,38,4 years ago,4 stars,"Same menu as every McDonald's everywhere, and the quality is just fine. The big advantage of this location is that it's just off the strip, so it has more normal prices, and it's not as crowded."
17941,38,4 years ago,1 star,Always leaving off specified add-ons or ignoring substitutions even with display screen& reciting orderï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
17942,38,5 years ago,4 stars,We stayed at the Tropicana and didnt want to pay $21.95 each for breakfast so we went here.  It was a 10 minute walk ( it's across from Mandalay Bay) and encountered 2 homeless men along the way but it was worth the walk.  Food and service were excellent and the prices the same as other McDonalds.   The place is new and clean.   The is also a Subway in the strip mall.   Highy recommend if you can stand the heat durind the walk.
17943,38,3 years ago,2 stars,"Meh...just meh. Back in the day McDonalds was a treat you looked forward to, now the foods more expensive, the fries are never fresh, and the buns are usually stale. They've dropped the ball."
17944,38,5 years ago,1 star,"Totally rude customer service. When we asked to fix the problems they snarled with their pissy attitudes.
The women's name was Bryanna who denied me a simplebsqueeze of whipped cream.
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER !!"
17945,38,3 years ago,1 star,This place wasn't the best. The worst food I had the entire trip the soda wasn't mixed well either. I do hope they were having an off day and things get better for them.

17950,38,2 years ago,2 stars,This McD's location has NO sit down dinning available. I requested extra pickles and still got only 1 pickle per cheese burger. Lame.

I thought it was a bit untidy here (trash on the floor) and some tables were not clean. I have to complain about that, hence the two star deduction, since cleanliness and hygiene are the top priorities in a restaurant.
The toilets were also a bit messy, but at least the bowl was clean so far.

When the manager came to take cash they gave a look like we were crazy then said you ""you know we have a cash kiosk?"", to which I responded that people are at it.

I called and the Lady on the phone left me waiting on hold. I'll seek for an investigation in this situation. hopefully Public resources are being well managed, RIGHT? ï¿½ï"
18716,26,a month ago,2 stars,"A disappointing visit. We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register. We waited over 20 minutes for 3 standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant. The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders. While waiting, we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it. At that point, I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn't realize it hadn't been served. We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something, whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for. The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything. They did make our order fresh once we asked for it, which is why I gave more that 1 star for the food. We would not return to this location."
18717,26,2 months ago,1 star,"Drive through experience. Long line, no problem, tourist area. Took a while to take my order. When I paid, the person didn't even make eye contact, he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window. Then, went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window. By the time I paid, at 10:02 pm, it was 10:20 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window. Then a female employee brought me a kid's meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order, she waved her hand and said ""I don't know"" with an attitude. She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said ""that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera"". He then said ""hold on"" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.
I'm a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members. My 6 year old grand-daughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation.

If u want you can order food through self-order screen inside the cafe, drive through is also available. Good for kids as well because there is a kids playing area inside the cafe."
18733,26,a year ago,5 stars,Manager was great. He unlocked the door just before closing to take my order. I was staying at the hotel next-door so i didnt drive over.

18737,26,2 months ago,1 star,"Instead of the manager (Isiah) helping my kids, he decides to send someone else so he can go converse with someone else. They were paying customers just like everyone else he helped. Thank you to the people that helped my kids."
18738,26,2 months ago,3 stars,Food isn't always hit. Nonmatter when I go. And even if I order a kids meal we always have to pull around and wait for our order. It's very slow service
18739,26,3 months ago,1 star,"Sign indicates free item if the person taking your order doesn't ask about rewards. The Male taking our order didn't ask. We told them at the window. The manager told us the girl that took our order did ask us we explained that it wasn't a girl it was the man. To which she rolled her eyes,walked away and didn't return. We also didn't recieve our bottle water, napkins  nor straws for the drinks we did get."
18740,26,5 months ago,3 stars,"Tiny cramped parking lot makes it hard to get in and out of. Location is in a really commercial touristy area so it's to be expected, I suppose. Didn't go inside, so this is just the drive thru experience. Dual drive thru lines were wrapped around the building at 10pm on a Sunday.
Food ok. Fries and fish bun were a bit stale, considering the long line, was expecting fresher food, I guess.  Good enough for a late snack."
18741,26,4 months ago,5 stars,This store is always clean. The staff always pleasant and helpful. I've been impressed with them the whole 7 months I've been here.
18742,26,7 months ago,1 star,"Lucky they even get the rating they do. Placed a mobile app order at 9:49am and was still waiting for 3 sandwiches 45 minutes later. Not a single person acknowledged me standing at the front counter, but had no problem passing orders out to those using the kiosk. Go thru the drive thru to be given the excuse that their ""short handed"", yet I spent 45 minutes INSIDE and seen plenty of employees. My order was wrong twice. Absolutely cold food. Sent a complaint to corporate because this is unacceptable. This location is full of tourist and I hate for these people visiting our state and area to be treated the way I was. Absolutely uncalled for!"

The manager is rude the advertising is false. She accused us of lieing when we said we weren't asked about the rewards to receive the free cookie.  Very hostile !"
18746,26,5 years ago,4 stars,"Clean place with prompt, and accurate service. The chicken nuggets were delicious and crunchy!    We ordered through the Drive Thru with hardly any wait time.  The attendant confirmed our order no less than twice, and I was given exactly what we asked.

The inside is clean (as well as the bathrooms) and has a lot of seating.  There's also an indoor play area for the kiddos.  In this location you place your order on the touch screens in front of the cashiers."
18747,26,4 years ago,1 star,Not satisfied with purchase. Female manager messed up my order twice. My tripple hamburger looked like someone added two miniature paddies on a normal size burger. I would recommend that this supervisor pays attention to receipts and ask for additional help in order to avoid mistakes.
18748,26,6 months ago,5 stars,This is by far the best McDonald's I have ever been too. They serve you your food very quickly and take your trash. They walk around asking if you need anything and are very friendly. Very clean as well.
18749,26,a year ago,1 star,"If I could I would give -10 stars because I stayed here in Orlando all week and they never wanted to take my order, they locked all the doors at night, they say they close at 11pm and for example I arrived at 9:40 and they told me that it was closed, please McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s do something, this is happening to me all nights, Im from Mexico and I dont have a car or the App from here (even if its the same is different) they are rude and not attentive.

18751,26,4 months ago,5 stars,"Quick food, pretty clean environment, cheap food. It's a McDonald's, they don't vary too much in general. Though there are outliers, this one is consistent with what I've come to expect of McDonald's."

18758,26,2 months ago,5 stars,Very long wait time but the food was good and the young lady at the second window was so nice
18759,26,6 months ago,1 star,Lost our order. Waited 45 min for a burger fries and a box of nuggets. Then they accuse us of trying to get a duplicate order for Free. They clearly have problems.  We tossed a twenty dollar bill at them and asked for the food. NEVER GO to this location.  EVER

Next day went bck hoping to get a different experience... the guy on the floor was really nice and polite but the middle eastern cashiers.... not so much!!!! Im standing their waiting to be assisted but instead the latina looking and the middle eastern had a more important conversation of how to remove her nose piercing and how to clean it! Also she was manipulating her nose while at the csshier! So so disgusting!!! Grosss!!!!!"

18770,26,a year ago,1 star,I ordered the 2 for 4.49 crispy chicken biscuits for breakfast and they gave me the 2 for 3 mc chicken sandwich and then when I asked the manager Monica.why was i charged so much for sandwiches I didn't order she told me that she was short-staffed and didn't have time to fix it and gave me an attitude.
18771,26,a month ago,3 stars,This McDonald's is way more efficient than the other McDonald's down by  Animal Kingdom with the drive thru they are also a lot more friendlier at least on the intercom. But they didn't cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was disgusting. I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for proof. I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it isn't cooked all the way. She takes the burger doesn't say anything and shuts the door with me standing outside. I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I didn't know if she was going to. I didn't get an apology though for my burger not being cooked all the way through though.
18772,26,2 months ago,3 stars,Not sure I have ever been to one that deserves 5 stars.  This was run of the meal McDonalds.  Average in everyway.
18773,26,3 months ago,1 star,this mcdonald's is not open 24 hours despite all signage and hours posted. an employee rudely shooed me away when i showed up at 1:30 AM.
18774,26,7 months ago,3 stars,Went there for Doordash pick up. Store was close. So I parkedy car and walked to the drive-through window. A staff told me I have to get in line with all the drive through customers. Which took me almost half an hour just to get to the window in my car. That's nuts. The order has already been placed and all I'm doing is just picking it up. You guys gotta find a better system or else close this place down if you can't get it together.

18779,26,7 months ago,4 stars,It's McDonald's. You know what you're getting. You know that every once in awhile and order is going to be messed up but if you walk in they're going to fix it for you and probably throw in a free French fry. There's no reason to give these service workers a hard time they're doing what they can. Thanks guys. Everyone once in awhile I want some chicken nuggies and and it's always you guys and your sweet and sour love sauce. Hot mustard is acceptable sometimes.
18780,26,4 years ago,1 star,"Terrible service,we have to go back 3  times since they forgot my big mac   , bbq's
Sauce  sweet sour souce  ,and my large order  fries with only half full.  The last thing is herzelnut iced coffee  with none flavor that I have to dumped away after first dip.  The most important thing is The only one staff seems so mad at work. When she doing the fries,one empty fries bag dropped on the floor,she got so pissed  threw a whole bunch fries bag on the floor.  She seems the manager, no other staff dared to point this out. They all just keep silent and clean the mess. If you are not in the mood ,go home plz. When comes to customer service, be nice then . That is the priority of your duty and responsibility."

Even if you were closed despite sign stating 24 hrs the lease you could do is have some decency and say something. Really poor service. T
18790,26,8 months ago,1 star,"Companies need to understand it's not 2020 anymore. The public is tired of your excuses. Be aware this location starts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash, and mobile orders are not accepted, and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this. Maybe it's legit, seems shady though. If anything it is poor management. It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be. But you should have it ready to go by time your breakfast hours start, and the mobile app should not be accepting orders."

18794,26,3 years ago,5 stars,Stopped in for fast coffee but instead had the pleasure of watching Angelica work her customer service magic. She took the time to rework a customers order to take advantage of saving. His way of ordering would have cost $14 but with her assistance it was just $8. A blessing for this customer as he is on standby for the birth of his third granddaughter. Doesn't matter if you are spending $1 or $100...good customer service is hard to find. Stop in and get your savings with Angelica should you be in the area. ï¿½ï

18798,26,11 months ago,3 stars,"It's McDonald's, what can I say. Food is good but what we all really judge from them is their service. Always check your order, 80% of the time, they will always get big orders wrong. Can't blame them when we expect our food fast."
18799,26,6 months ago,4 stars,"As a McDonald's goes it was great. Fries where hot, burger fresh and the pies where hot. My only complaint is that the opinions where very limited."
18800,26,a year ago,2 stars,"I GIVE IT 2 STARS because they were quick.But on the other hand,The fries were cold,and the burgers were drenched with ketchup. Told the gentleman to hold one moment and 5 seconds later a girl came on. Like give us a minute. I normally don't write a review and I hate to leave a bad one.But you would think because it's in front of oldtown it's hot and fresh. Just got out of the hospital wanted a warm meal."

When I arrived and have waited in the line the man taking the orders in the drive through said our Uber order would be ready at the second window.

I was greeted at the drive thru with ""we're only taking one order at a time, there are 2 people in front of you, I'll get to you when I can"" so I thought maybe they were severely understaffed. After 20 minutes at the speaker waiting, I pulled off without ever being spoken to again, to find at least 6 or 7 staff members kind of just hanging out inside, surely not moving the drive thru line along."
18805,26,9 months ago,1 star,"Most unprofessional and rude mcdonalds I have ever been to.
I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke. When I got to work I'm happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both. When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it. I couldn't make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up. Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldn't go pick it back up. When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not. Which it was the same manager.

Always a problem in this branch! Either order is wrong, or missing key ingredients in burgers (like ketchup for example), or stale meat ingredients, or the high prices, or the 45 -60 minutes long lines, etc.. What broke the camel back for me was when some customers would skip the drive thru line and when speaking to the McDonald's manager, I was told there's nothing they can do about it. Very bad area to be in for sure. Ghetto employees and ghetto customers. Better to drive couple more miles either way on 192 than to come here!"

Though one of the managers was having to deal with a former employee that was trying to make a scene when the employee was clearly in the wrong, the manager kept her calm and remained professional as to not allow the situation to affect those in the restaurant. Very nice experience and would come back again when I am in the area!"

My wife is pregnant and was really craving and ice cream fudge Sunday their ice cream machine was down. I had ice cream at home but no hot fudge ask them to give me a couple few squirts of it and they obliged even though they didn't have a button for it I'm really happy and so is my wife thank you very much. Very chill people, appreciate you!"

18830,26,a year ago,3 stars,"Strange management??? Got what I ordered,  but had to do at kiosk.   No one at the register taking orders.   My diet coke barely had any ice.  When I asked for ice, I got deer in the headlights look.  Food was as expected,  but very strange experience.   I would not go back."

18833,26,a year ago,1 star,Waited 19min for a single happy meal. Drive thru was not overly busy (2-3 cars past the order area). Dining room had moderate amount of guests ordering and waiting (never more than 5/6 groups). I counted 8 workers. I just needed a hamburger and 2 happy meal friesï¿½

18837,26,2 years ago,2 stars,"Every time I came during my two week visit I was asked to pull forward into the parking spots where the mobile ordering area is, there was always 2-4  cars pulled up waiting for food just so they can make their drive thru times better. No one wants to pull forward for you to make your ratings look better. Get it together ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"

18842,26,a year ago,1 star,"Don't eat here! Order is always wrong, takes forever, fries are cold and gross. Dining room ""closes"" at 11pm. NOPE! Really closes at like 8pm. Update the hours on your door!!! When we knocked on the door and pointed to the sign, THE MANAGER FLIPPED US OFF!

Cooperate needs to fire most the staff, all the managers, and get new people in there."
18843,26,3 months ago,1 star,DO NOT GO HERE!  This was the most unprofessional treatment that we ever received by McDonald's. We felt like we couldn't even report it because we didn't have a name to call up the next day and speak to a manager he wouldn't even give us a name

18850,26,a year ago,1 star,The drive through guy was super disrespectful and awful to deal with. We had ordered online and they said it didn't go through even though it charged us so instead of providing a solution he stood staring not saying anything. As well as when we got the food and asked if that was all and he rolled his eyes and said nothing. Absolutely one of the worst experiences in a drive through. 0

18854,26,a year ago,1 star,Lines longer than Disney. Staff walk around clueless half the time. Not sure if understaffed or undertrained. Corporate needs to come and take a look at this one or shut it down. Been this way for years now. Always the same. Always cash only at night.

18857,26,a year ago,2 stars,"Used a deal at the kiosk for a free kids meal w/ combo purchase and when I went to check out it said ""Deal is unavailable"" & wiped out the order forcing me to re-enter everything and the deal code was now invalid. I get that they are for ""participating locations"", but if you're not a participating location, put up a sign or something so I don't waste my time.
The drink fountain was closed 'to keep the restaurant clean' according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said ""We don't do refills here"". What? Seriously? Unlike every other McDonald's? You're gonna give me the saltiest fries ever and then make me pay for a refill? Again, if that is this location's policy, fine. But post a sign so that the expectation is set"
18858,26,2 years ago,2 stars,"One of my favorite features of McDonald's for me is that I know what I can expect; offerings, flavors, etc.
This is true for this particular restaurant, however, it seems that being soooo busy (I guess excellent location) makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers.

Running out of lettuce, running out ""of many things"", are management/logistics problems. Bad attitude, lack of courtesy, well I guess that problem is on us, the customers, right?

The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market still, regardless of attitude and bad manners."

18860,26,a year ago,1 star,"I ordered cookies and chocolate chip then I went to pay. The cashier was very rude he didnt greet me, didnt look me in the eye, and just announced  the price with no manners such as please. The lady at the drive through just shoved the bag at us, no eye contact either. Training for the workers at this Mcdonalds is lacking."
18861,26,a year ago,4 stars,"This McDonald's usually ROCKS!
They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min.

Tonight,  there was no line. Also the inside was closed. AND...  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN/SHUT OFF. SHOCKER.

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat. So thats why we went.

Then they didn't put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off. 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot.
So... I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag. She said No, we can't do that.
REALLY!?!?!?! I have worked in the food industry for 28 years.  I am well aware of what you can and can not do.
You didn't WANT TO. You didn't want to value me as a person, a customer,  or a future. You didn't want to do your job properly in the 1st place. You didn't want to apologize in any way shape or form.

I don't mind that a mistake was made. I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with.

There are 22 other fast food locations in the quarter mile radius."

18863,26,a year ago,1 star,"Just went to this location. Worst service I ever had! I was unable to process my orden with the Kiosk. After I couldn't make the order I was standing at the line and the employee said all orders needed to be thru the Kiosk. I told them I tried it and was unable to complete the order and I prefer (wanted) to do it thru cashier. Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru. To be honest, that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional. Where is the customer service or Customer Service satisfaction?? You can not force your customers to do only kiosk!!!! What about people that can't read??? Are they not allowed to go inside the restaurant just because they can't make the order at the kiosk??"
18864,26,a year ago,1 star,"Self ordering stations inside offer a milk alternative for coffee and that's what we (thought we) got. Went through the drive through to be told they dont offer such a thing. My husband was in the middle of explaining the situation to the manager at the window when she just turned and walked away. My husband had to get her attention to finish explaining that the menu inside has it on there. She was slightly aggressive,  we left."

I arrived from my trip at 3:00am today 02/26/22 and the cashier notified me to wait.
After 30 minutes without attending to me in the self-service line, I decided to check if there was someone to attend me and nobody came out or said anything.  It is a lack of respect."

The McNuggets were even good 3 Days later according to my daughter :-)"

It was hot but  seemed like they forgot to season it as it was very bland and basically had no taste at all. The only thing I tasted was the two pickles on the sandwich. I definitely will not get this sandwich again here. I have to say overall ordering the crispy chicken sandwich at any McDonald's is a major gamble. I have gotten it once or twice before when it was really good but more often than not it has not been good at all... Bland, burnt, dry, etc .. take my advice don't get the c"

18876,26,a year ago,5 stars,"Really great service at this McDonald's, manager Joseph was very helpful In getting my order placed with my over tired 3 year old.   Very friendly staff.  Food was hot and tasty but the staff makes this place stand out from the countless other McDonald's visits I have had."
18877,26,a year ago,2 stars,"Our order was incorrect. We ordered a Big Mac meal - with a large coke and a medium caramel frappe. We were handed a medium coke with the meal and frappe. When we said the coke was supposed to be large, the worker (Manager) asked for the receipt, which shows:
1 Big Mac Ml-Lrg
1 M Coke
Then she said: You have to ask for a large- We did!! She didn't offer to correct their error.
When do you ever order a large meal with a medium drink????? The fry was a large, but they were cold. The Big Mac was dry. I forgot why we don't usually go to McDonald's. Thank you for reminding me."
18878,26,a year ago,5 stars,Awesome customers service. So so nice is an understatement of the employees. Fell in love with Micky D again after having lunch here.
18879,26,a year ago,1 star,No contact with the workers till they delivered.  Basically you were ignored unless you yelled loudly for attention.  Very disappointed and will never visit there again.

18884,26,a year ago,5 stars,We use the McDonald's app on our phones. They have the best deals for lunch. Most times they have if you buy one sandwich you get a second sandwich for $.29 They also have a large French fry for $1.00.
18885,26,3 years ago,1 star,"Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. The food was dry, we had to ask for our drinks three times and we had to ask for the Happy Meal toy. There was one helpful young woman working front cash, who got the last drink sorted out. But won't be back unless management starts checking in and doing a better job motivating employees."

18891,26,a year ago,2 stars,"Says 24 hour drive through. They're always closed, shut down, doing maintenance, only cash, systems are down, or some other reasons why they can't serve the early risers. They shouldn't post on the signa that the drive through is open just to not serve anyone or have it on maps that they are open just to refuse customers."

18898,26,a year ago,5 stars,This McDonald's uses a kiosk for inside food ordering. However if you have problems they will take your order personally. My meal was very good and fast.

18900,26,2 years ago,1 star,"Hey, we just left this place. Had a big order - lots of people hungry after getting to town late. Among other things, we ordered 3 orders of 20 nuggets, 4 large fries, a bunch of dbl cheeseburgers and a quarter pounder. Know what we got? A drink we didn't order, an apple pie we didn't order, an ice cream we didn't order, and one 10 piece nugget. In a big bag that looked enough like one that would hold our order - our bad, I guess, but our not checking closely enough just doesn't excuse just not getting 40+ $ worth of food. And then they don't answer when we try to call. Absolutely terrible store."

18902,26,5 years ago,5 stars,The cleanest McDonald's I've ever visited. The staff was unusually helpful and attentive. The checked in with us twice in the dining area to make sure our food was satisfactory and offered to get beverage refills for us and to bus our table for us. Very well run establishment. A completely new fast food experience for my family. The food was good.
18903,26,2 years ago,1 star,The people in this place could not get any more Dumber. Made it a point to order by the number on the menu board and they still are able to screw that up. Super great place to visit if your intention is to go through the drive-thru then have to park and go inside and fix your order each time.

18908,26,3 years ago,5 stars,Clean location good staff thanks !
18909,26,a year ago,3 stars,Food was fresh. Person at the window needs to learn manners. If a customer says thank you your suppose to say your welcome. It's customer service.

18916,26,5 years ago,4 stars,Pretty decent but the machines you go to for ordering was usually broken. I'm pretty sure the ice cream machine was broken at one point because we couldn't order any ice cream related products. All along it was a decent experience and I would probably go back again if I'm ever in the area again.
18917,26,5 years ago,4 stars,"Excellent and fresh, hot, food.  The inside is spacious and clean. Friendly staff but I don't like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch pad, makes it hard to customize your order and confusing.  I'd rather just wait in line and have the attendants take my order like most McDonald's.  But at this McDonald's you must order at the touch pad by yourself."
18918,26,2 years ago,1 star,"Terrible customer service.....ordered from the kiosk, was the only person waiting at the counter and not one person acknowledged me. To make matters worse, the manager was assisting in fulfilling orders instead of delegating her employees. While they stood and had conversation I waited 15 min before I received a ""Did you order?""

18923,26,6 years ago,4 stars,"We came here twice during our visit to the area. The first day, I would have given them 5 stars; the service was fantastic and, despite being extremely busy, they gave great attention to each guest. The second time, however, we came through the drive through and the service was terrible. It was very early in the morning, there were only a few other cars in line (maybe 3 in front of us?) and we were in line for at least 15 minutes."
18924,26,a year ago,5 stars,"I needed a quick meal will on break at the Gaylord Palm business convention.

Pros: any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land. They keep the same consistent taste world wide. as a business owner this is admirable. This location was efficient and fast.

Cons: we all know it's not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location
So I only ate it once on my 5 day stay.
McDonald's should explore healthier options for the current market . But still a great experience

18926,26,5 years ago,1 star,I had the worst experience at this location. I went to the drive thru and only ordered 2 hamburgers and a small fry. I paid and pulled up to get my food and was given the wrong order. I let the associate know it wasn't correct. He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food. As I sat and waited time was just ticking by. After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food. No one came back. I knocked on the glass and no response. As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed. I asked where my food was and he said he was making it. I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying. I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened. I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later. He said oh I'm sorry they're new. Terrible customer service and uncaring management.
18927,26,5 years ago,1 star,"Service was trash, took them 20 minutes to take my order (no exaggerations... Seriously), can't even salt fries for some reason, and the employees weren't able to organize correctly. For example, at one point, there were three employees gathered around to fill one order.

So, putting it in relative perspective, it wasn't that bad for this area.  We're going again this morning (I'm not a fast food fan, but hotel breakfast is just pastries), so I'll update the review if my experience is different.

There were many spots to see, unappetizing. if the area for the guests looks like, how is it in the kitchen. I do not want to imagine it. I will not go there a second time."
18935,26,5 years ago,3 stars,I felt so bad about how crazy busy they were that I wanted to jump behind the counter and help hand out bags! They did the best they could considering how hectic it was... and it was 11pm. It was pretty cool to see the kiosk that you can order from. Much rather order my food through that than a person.
18936,26,4 years ago,4 stars,Kind of touch and go with this location. Sometimes they're very attentive and sometimes they don't listen when you're trying to give them your order. Late night is when I've generally had problems with their service. Otherwise they are pretty good.
18937,26,2 years ago,1 star,I placed my order at 7:33pm tonight and got the order at about 8:15pm.  I had to call to make sure they received my order. Apparently they either forgot or overlooked it.  Usually they would throw in a free item to make you happy..   not this place.
18938,26,4 years ago,1 star,"This was the worst McDonald's I've been in. We ordered using the kiosk and  they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food. We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy. The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband's drink. He went to the counter to get it and they didn't believe him at first. My coffee had the label on it for what I'd ordered but it didn't have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it, took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds. The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid. I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered. Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot. The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald's for a while. The staff didn't seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald's website and we left."
18939,26,5 years ago,1 star,"I placed an order about an hour ago only to find out that half of my order was missing. I called this location to let them know that I was missing half my order. The manager, Judith, stated that if I don't come before 4am them I'd have to wait until the next day to receive my order. Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule based, I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into mine. I understand that my items were not available after that time, but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they created. I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on vacation. The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are ""too busy""."
18940,26,3 years ago,1 star,"I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald's to in the past.
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while."

18942,26,3 years ago,2 stars,"The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonald's was because of my youngest daughter. But what we experienced today put an end to it. The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving  customers in the drive thru area. As you noticed, there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case. The associate, instead of been polite, talked to us in a not too pleasant tone. I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up. Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience. I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience."

18947,26,3 years ago,4 stars,Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow. I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins & a large french vanilla coffee.

Best fries I have had in a while. Also got a cheeseburger and I must admit I was also pleased as I hate it when I decide to actually eat 1,000 calories and my cheese is thrown in my hamburger and not even melted yucky.

He came back frustrated with only 2 so I told him to go back for more. He asked the manager 4 times to her face very nicely for 2 more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way. Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother. Not impressed"

If you are a tourist and don't know when it is cash only you don't get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on.

18962,26,5 years ago,1 star,"Worst customer service ever!! I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru. Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family, I explained I cannot come back next day, but would come following Sunday, she agreed and hung up. On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order. While on the service line, she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line, she asks me yelling, what is your name, I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE, other customers included, yells again, ""she tells me you came in already!!"" I replied NO, at this point I'm embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down. Twenty minutes later, I finally get the order. I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold. The manager grunts and agrees to. After my family were done with their meals, we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done. When we returned, we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate, they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered. Incredible! Bottom line, we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald's came through, we got yelled at by the manager, embarrased, long wait for food, missing food items, and pissy attitude by staff. Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for. Sorry that we don't have negative stars because this location would take them all."

The 78th Street Tampa Florida branch is always on their mark, quick efficient usually correct with my order of hot tasty food. I can't believe how much I've been eating at McDonald's the last 3 years after many many years of barely ever going there since I was a teenager in the 1970s. Food is definitely better than it used to be, and I love getting deals with their online phone app and food questionnaires for freebies from the receipts."

Or nothing.

Great customer service... NOT"
18975,26,3 years ago,1 star,"If it were possible to leave 0 stars I would. Absolutely zero customer service. The only interaction with both guys at the drive thru was when the order was placed, neither of them spoke a word in person. The guy at the payment window was too busy talking with the guy who would be the person to push the food out of the window and he couldn't be bothered to tell us which of the 2 pick up windows to stop at. I would say that the behavior could have been excused if they were busy, but they weren't at all. Yet even being busy doesnt excuse the gross lack of basic human interaction."
18976,26,6 years ago,4 stars,"Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for adults. The food is your typical McDonald's fare with nothing special to write about. They have a large parking lot, and the bathrooms were clean during my visit. My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant. It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand. Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays."

18988,26,10 months ago,1 star,"If Mc D thinks Kiosk service is the future, I would SELL My Stock!
Probably the Worst Mc D experience I have Ever had..."
18989,26,2 years ago,2 stars,This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's
18990,26,5 years ago,3 stars,Good for a quick bite on the go with a busy day right across the street from Old Town this place is got an indoor playground which is nice. The kids enjoyed it the one time we came in and stopped and let them play. Unfortunately the last time we came through the drive-thru and there was a vagrant near the one entrance so that was a little unsettling other than that has McDonald's go it was okay
18991,26,10 months ago,5 stars,40 chicken nuggets and 2 large fries for 15 bucks!! Also the ice tea is the best in Florida
18992,26,2 years ago,2 stars,So disappointed... I entered this restaurant only to be confronted with a computer taking my order..  which was Not working!! No one noticed we were having difficulty.  So frustrating. Wont come here again for a long time!

18995,26,3 years ago,2 stars,"the drive-thru line is super long and aside from that, the people who should be taking your order there don't even answer when you get to the ordering station. It took us about 15 minutes to get a simple order and that was too long."
18996,26,a year ago,1 star,One worker was very rude and I over heard him cussing at another customer. My order was wrong and I had to go back to get it fixed.b
18997,26,5 years ago,4 stars,Great workers were very helpful. Eating area play area were clean. Men's bathroom was quite messy and the toilet paper holder was torn off the wall. Overall will come again.

19001,26,4 years ago,1 star,"This location has slow service and horrible customer service.  The computer order machine was not working,  instead of informing custmers they said nothing. Orders were backed up and the staff acted like nothing was wrong. What kind of training is McDonalds giving their employees.  For such a big business  and being involved in so many charities you think , they would emphasize excellent customer service. McDonalds you are slipping."
19002,26,3 years ago,1 star,This McDonald's was the worst i haver ever been in.  ZERO STARS. Floor in entrance was flooded. Bathrooms disgusting. Soda bar dirty and filthy with no ice. Garbage cans over flowing. 12 to 15 people inside with one person working the register. This after sitting in drive through fir 5 to 8 minutes without moving.
19003,26,5 years ago,1 star,What is the point in having employees in a store if they don't help you? The employees talking to each other and when you want to place an order they tell you to place it on the machine. The store was empty! What are they there for if the machine is going to take your order? They are getting paid to chit chat? Bad customer service.
19004,26,a year ago,5 stars,We ordered through the app and we just went up said our order number and our order was ready by the time we got to the window and nothing was missing! Fantastic service!
19005,26,5 months ago,4 stars,Very clean and it taste as usual

19007,26,9 years ago,3 stars,Absolutely the worst service I have ever had at a Mcd's. The place was busy and lacked the people/system to handle it. Customers angry having to wait so long for food while others had to return theirs because of inaccurate orders. It took me 20 minutes to get a simple order - one chicken wrap with sweet tea.
19008,26,6 months ago,4 stars,It's a good place for fast food
19009,26,10 months ago,1 star,Got the order wrong. Went back. They told me to pull up 2nd window.  They forgot me. Then got the order wrong again.
19010,26,a year ago,1 star,If you like to sit in the pick up line for 20 minutes and when you finally get your food it is not at all what you ordered then this is the place for you.
19011,26,a year ago,1 star,"Credit card processing down, it happens. But let me know instead of telling me  after 45 min in line. Sharpie paper and some tape ."
19012,26,5 years ago,2 stars,"The facility is a contemporary fast food restaurant with self ordering stations; making orders fast and reliable. Notwithstanding, the manager needs to work in interpersonal tact with her staff. Ultimately, the store next to McDonald gives customers a ""free gift"" if you bring your McDonald's receipt."
19013,26,a year ago,1 star,"Food was decent until I found a tooth pick in my fries , unfortunately there wasn't anything I can do or say since I was just passing through on vacation from Chicago"
19014,26,6 years ago,4 stars,"I frequent the drive thru here quite often and since their update the speed of service has increased.

Even though I am trying  to eat healthier these days I just can't stay away from my all time favorite Egg McMuffin. These ladies and gentleman are always fast and friendly  with a delicious sandwich."
19015,26,8 years ago,1 star,"Spent 15 minutes in the drive-thru,  most of which was sitting at the window waiting for my food. Didn't get a straw, my double cheeseburger had no cheese and my son's happy meal had no toy. All I ordered was a a double cheese meal and a happy meal and you couldn't get either one right even after a 15 minute wait. Completely unacceptable."
19016,26,a year ago,4 stars,The ice cream machine was actually working at this store. Drive thru speaker was hard to hear. No wait and quick service.
19017,26,2 years ago,1 star,If I could rate a 0 I would. I didn't even get my order because I had to wait so long. What fast food experience EVER!
19018,26,3 years ago,5 stars,"Not from Florida..but every McDonald's I visited in this area was some of the best experiences you could ask for. Nice people. Fast fresh food. Super fun play areas, no complaints whatsoever."
19019,26,3 years ago,5 stars,Nice place to eat anytime you want. They are very busy. People come by the bus loads to eat hamburgers all over. It's a tourist trap. Cheap and hot food. Your money goes far. Most people go there for a quick meal and internet which is free.
19020,26,5 years ago,3 stars,"3 stars for being a clean and friendly McDonald's but it'll never be a 5 star stop because they NEVER have ice cream. Doesn't matter where you go there's a 90% chance they are out or the machine is down. Morning? Down. Afternoon? Down? Nighttime? Down. Halloween? Down. On Halloween?! Yes, completely down all night. I know that ice cream machines being down is a running joke but this location is the king of it."
19021,26,a year ago,1 star,"The staff here is not friendly at all. Where I grew up, you greet somebody, or at least say something. The drinks tasted horrible."
19022,26,3 years ago,1 star,"Absolutely Terrible Food ! No OPTIONS for Anything even remotely Healthy,  The staff is polite,  but McDonald's You WILL continue to lose business!  People are finally looking at All the disgusting ingredients that's in the production of your food. Even the yogurt has MORE SUGAR THAN A SUNDAY , I wouldn't even recommend the fries , Unless you want a Heart attack , with  a side of High blood pressure and Diabetes with a POSSIBLY of cancer, then okay go for it ."
19023,26,3 years ago,1 star,"Absolutely the worst service! They ""can't figure out the mobile app orders"" when asked how to fix issues with long wait times the ride staff just says ""what do you want me to do?"" If you like people being rude to you and very slow service this is your place to not eat!"
19024,26,6 months ago,3 stars,Very close to Disney.  Clean and quick service.
19025,26,a year ago,3 stars,"They did not get my order right at the drive-thru, so I had to go back and was late for work"
19026,26,5 years ago,1 star,Seems like the more one goes to this location...the worse it gets....toasting an English muffin should not be a difficult task... it wouldn't be bad....but lying about toasting it .......Shame on them.....apparently after a certain hour it is..not a priority to make decent food for the public......or decent fries...not to mention a double cheeseburger... simply gross.. Good grief....this place is certainly disappearing from my list of quick stops...to keep going by  cause Checkers is right down the road...
19027,26,a year ago,3 stars,Have to place your own order. They forgot some of our food. Bathrooms smelled. Play area still closed.
19028,26,10 years ago,2 stars,"Very busy. Very dirty. One cashier and at least 10 people working. Line was long, the boy taking orders was moving at half the speed of smell.

I watched four groups walk out. We should have followed."

19030,26,9 years ago,1 star,"I have been staying at the Holiday Inn next door to the McDonald's for four days now. Every morning we walk over to McDonald's to get bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits and hash browns. EVERY SINGLE MORNING that we've went over there, we have gotten hard, rubbery, cold, biscuits. Their hash browns are hard as well, and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up.

I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with ""better biscuits"". However, the replacement biscuits were undercooked. They were very doughy. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food."
19031,26,2 years ago,1 star,"Just went and got 4 McChicken, 1 Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger.

The entire order was old. French fries were saggy like and old lady titis. The McChicken tastes like they were cooked a month ago. Aaaah wait no coke because the machine was down. First is the shake machine and now the coke. Come on man. Worst MCDONALD Ever fuuuuck"
19032,26,2 years ago,3 stars,"Totally hit or miss.. Old town is near by . So Friday nights and weekend's are busy at night. However, decent staff and consistent with the chains food quality."
19033,26,4 years ago,2 stars,I visited this McDonalds on my way home from Walt disney world with my kids 8 and 13. I went through the drive through so I could get back on the road to get home our order was not right onions on everything we asked for no onion and short a French fry. Also has no ketchup in the bag and I asked for more because our kids use a lot and was told no it was in the bag. I do not recommend the drive through.
19034,26,4 years ago,2 stars,Horrible service. General manager was in the store at the time. Was punishing an employee in front of everybody. Should've been more professional and took him in the back area. I waited 10 minutes no one in front of me and no one in the drive thru and my food still was not fresh. Don't recommend this location unless you can't get to a different location.
19035,26,3 years ago,2 stars,"Very busy,  mad customers, long wait times for orders.  The staff is trying their best but can't keep up.  They need a new streamlined process and only one conductor."
19036,26,a year ago,4 stars,Food was fine but line at drive thru was slow possibly because girl working window was more interested in texting then waiting on customers
19037,26,4 years ago,1 star,"I guess when you're in a tourist area you don't have to worry about pleasing your local customers for return business. Stale burger buns, cold and burnt french fries.  Medium fries box was about 2/3 full.  Drive thru employee didn't say two words to me beyond the price of my meal."
19038,26,3 years ago,3 stars,The Asian looking manager killed my vibe. I was asking questions about their cafe drinks in a bubbly tone and he just replied in a really monotone voice. I was trying to make conversation and he just ignored me.... now I feel awkward as hell...
19039,26,a year ago,4 stars,The line for drive thru was out to the street! Not their fault it is not the first time. Once I got to pay point it was quick.
19040,26,3 years ago,1 star,I went through the drive-thru at this location and ordered a big Mac a large fry two McDoubles as well as a medium caramel frappe however when I return to my room the big Mac was missing as well as the cookies so I drove back up to the location I've now been sitting here over 20 minutes and nobody has come outside to let me know what was going on I would highly recommend finding another McDonald's to go to seeing as they don't seem to care about their customers
19041,26,3 years ago,3 stars,Not enough staff to take orders. While I had a very basic order it was wrong. Didn't make a big deal just left. Very clean restaurant however!! Also needs to have more English speaking associates
19042,26,4 years ago,1 star,"The worst McDonald's I've been to! Went in around 10 maybe 11 at night after visiting disney on the way back to our hotel. Went inside because the drive through line had at least 10 cars, no big deal. I was ordering a carryout. Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the 10 piece chicken nugget meal. I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store. I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then (my boys love McDonald's) she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day. I asked her name but it couldn't really understand what she said because she was talking fast. Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend, she didn't know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didn't remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it. Manager didn't believe me. I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal."
19043,26,5 years ago,1 star,"Quarter pound CB although made correctly with no onions was raw in the middle (not noticed until my husband was already almost done eating) then he just threw it away, hopefully he does not get sick. Kids meal CB ordered with no onions (not rang up that way) was covered in onions! Lessons here: cook outs not being done to make sure on quality & not serving raw product & cashier needs a little more training....because when I ordered my CB kids meal with no onions & a Large diet cook as the drink. He did not put on there the no onions & then asked me what did I want to drink."
19044,26,2 years ago,1 star,"It's really ridiculous that I'm coming every day for my breakfast at this branch and they don't care about customer satisfied, every morning I ordered 2 hot coffe and they gave me cold one! Again and again it happened"

19051,26,5 years ago,5 stars,"Truly one of the best Mc Donald's I've every been to! Best fries, the Big Mac actually looked like the photos you see! Being close to Disney, this location clearly works hard to make a great impression on tourists and it shows."
19052,26,4 years ago,1 star,"Morons running the restaurant. The $6 meal is a rip off. We asked if we could get the same deal but sub a side salad. They said yes then they over charged us and yold us ""oh no substitutions.""

19056,26,2 years ago,1 star,This is quite possibly one of the worst mcdonalds I have ever been to. Multiple times we have ordered mobile and whenever there is an issue the manager on duty blames us. He even felt the need to come out to my car and berate me over it.
19057,26,4 years ago,2 stars,"During the Daytime its alright, but at night they block one of the entrances with trash cans and lock the other one. (EVEN THOUGH THE SIGN STATES 24HR DINING ROOM) So you're forced to drive through. I didnt expect much but whatever...."

Before I left the lot from the drive through I checked everything.... The strips needed more cook time ""my opinion"" so I brought them inside and made the request.... Now it's McDonald's... you should expect some kickback or something but to my surprise I was really shocked and amazed that the order lady took it, told the M.O.D. and he says he can take care of it, he just needed about 5mins I told him no problem and waited. Now when I did receive it, he made sure he gave it to me, and when I got home to my surprise added an extra strip! 4 of 5 stars because the chicken sandwich was very delicious and the service blew me away but the strips I just didn't like."

19070,26,6 years ago,2 stars,"For kids its probably nice but adults running through or driving through for a quick bite you have to basically explain what you want on your burger. Ordered 2 mcdoubles with cheese and 2 small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked. Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat. And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger, and sadly I started with the fries. And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt. Never going back. Would rather go to checkers across the street."

19073,26,5 years ago,1 star,I am visiting Disney and staying in a hotel up the street. Have come here twice after leaving the park between 11-12:30. Each time I have waited in the drive through for over 15min just to place an order and then another 20min to pay/get the food. Only reason I don't leave is nothing else is open.
19074,26,5 years ago,2 stars,"The price is good using the McDonald's app with the dollar coke, what is the point of giving free French fries when they are cold. They were absolutely been trashed. Customer service was good this time."
19075,26,6 years ago,4 stars,"Read down place has changed a lot! Getting to be excellent place to go!

Not good, new construction is nice. But understaffed. Even at 2-3am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage. Also the floors heavily littered. Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant, but alot of foreign/domestic vacationers are just filthy. They just drop food and wrappers everywhere. When they are done eating they just get up and leave.
Host/busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs. More register coverage for the guests. When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient.
I have had 2-3 errors in my 8 visits. First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo. Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday's (yes 2 of them).
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left. The 2nd error wasn't caught till we where eating the Sunday's at home. I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund. At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both. Yeah it was only $1 and some change but it was the principal.
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home. I always request 2 plastic bag's for my food because the one paper bag they put my 6-8 burgers fails halfway home. The 2nd one is for the 3 Sunday's.

Another epic failure, ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions. 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular. Received the 2 mcdouble wo/mustard and onions no problem. 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail. 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail. 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries I've ever seen (guess they where kids sized) fail. The 20 peice fry came without incident. Less than 1/2 of the whole order came correctly....

Getting better and better, the manager Monique she runs a tight ship. Every time I'm in and she is there every thing is smooth sailing. A great thank you for your great service Monique!

Wow place was packed! Was able to wait just a short time and got my order. Looked around and yep there she was Monique steadily coordinating the staff! Must of been 30+ people in line only 5 min wait. Later I saw her again in the lobby assisting a guest with her drinks, both with smile's on."
19076,26,5 years ago,3 stars,I used to love this location. It is the close one to my home. But lately the service has gone down hill. Mostly through the drive thru where I usually get most of my orders! New management or what? Please quit thanking me so much and get my order right. Oh and when I say two cremes and 4 splendas in my coffee get it right. This morning the sticker they put on the coffee said 3 cremes and 4 sugars. I am diabetic. I tested it and it was not right so I waited to get to work and put one more splenda thinking they had not put the right amount. Drank about half when I noticed the sticker. That coffee affected my health because of the sugar! Their is kore but why bore you. Hope they change.
19077,26,4 years ago,5 stars,"This Mcdonald was very clean, the employee was so respectful I enjoyed eating here. The restroom was clean I actually allowed my little one use the restroom without worrying. The play house full of kids and very playful"
19078,26,3 years ago,5 stars,I had an order that was wrong. I went back the next morning and the manager gladly fix the mistake he was very professional very kind and I love this McDonald's I eat here almost every morning. It is a very good location the managers are very professional and friendly and I highly recommend this McDonald's above almost any other I've been to
19079,26,2 years ago,5 stars,Prince took my money and was a wonderful human being to transact with. He paid attention and knows how to give solid dollar bills change by asking for 55 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
19080,26,4 years ago,5 stars,I've been at this location a couple times. Definitely a faster service compared with the ones i've visited so far. The lady at the drive thru seem like she actually cared so that's always a plus
19081,26,a year ago,2 stars,Ordered mcdouble bundle no ketchup light onions and extra mustard I got cheese and pickles. The fries were terrible and my drink was fine.
19082,26,7 years ago,1 star,"& then they complain they get paid min wage. I'm aware this is a fast food place, so I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but the service here is extremely slow. The staff have no customer service. Avoid this place, unless you are literally in love with waiting"
19083,26,3 months ago,2 stars,The never has the coke icee.
19084,26,5 years ago,5 stars,"I had a great experience here. It's a very high traffic store but kids pretty clean, the staff was helpful and we got our food in less than 10 minutes after ordering from the kiosk."
19085,26,7 years ago,1 star,I work at Ponderosa Steakhouse next door to this McDonalds. I have visited this location many times. When there is no business and its slow the workers just stand around talking like nothing going on. I've tried to place my order many times in hopes that I'd receive my food fast enough to get my food and head to work next door before I have to clock in and start my shift. The management is slow and doesn't help out as I figured they wouldn't. My mother went here as well after dropping my off at work to only experience this as well. Many people have to wait foreverrrrr just to get a simple order. The last time I went I just ordered an ice coffee French vanilla and instead of handing me the ice coffee they placed it besides a counter and made me wait 12 minutes for it. I didn't ask anyone this time because im just feed up with this location. If you want McDonalds DO NOT! and I repeat DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!!! They care more about drivethrew then there customers eating inside or taking it to go!!!!!! I'd rare this place 0 if I could.
19086,26,5 years ago,1 star,Was given completely the wrong order after having to wait more then 10 minutes for what should have just been 2 burgers and fries. Called repeatedly to explain the error and got a busy tone every time.
19087,26,3 years ago,1 star,"This is by far the worst McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s EVER! The lobby was completely packed with people and they had one person on front line, they also made the food too early so by time the customers got their food it was cold and the employees were singing and goofing around and not doing their job, and it was very unprofessional! Finally the McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s were short handed and the drive thru line was big, and they were extremely slow and it took them 20 mi"
19088,26,4 years ago,1 star,"Very bad service. Theirs always a problem, to many workers not enough service. Too much hanging out like if their high school kids,  and they always have you wait in the parking lot for something,  and when it arrives they still forget something."
19089,26,a year ago,1 star,Slow as he'll and on top of everything I was missing food. After all the waiting. Never responded
19090,26,3 years ago,1 star,The worst McDonalds ever! After standing in a backed up line with one guy running the register who had no clue! A manager finally steps up to help and still the line remainder ridiculous! I started watching people just walkout because of the wait. This McDonalds is in a prime location and you would think they would be better prepared. Chick-fil-A is a block down the street and has a smaller parking lot and they never have the problem this McDonalds does.
19091,26,3 years ago,1 star,"The worst mcdonalds in any country I have visited. Food is ok, but the service was awful! There were more people queuing to complain than there were people sat in the restaurant. Staff were slow and not interested. Took over ten minutes just to serve some fries!"
19092,26,8 years ago,1 star,"Terrible service. Manager laughed in my face when I told them I was not satisfied with my food and service. I ordered the big breakfast without hotcakes. The eggs were old and half the portion that I normally get at any other location, the soda was flat, the coffee was cold and the staff is rude. This place should be shut down. Absolutely the worst McDonalds I've ever been to in my life."
19093,26,2 years ago,5 stars,I always go out of my way to go to this McDonald's they always make their french fries right well the way I like them the food is always hot service is always good looks like they're taking all covid precautions I recommend this one across from old Town
19094,26,3 years ago,1 star,Worst experience ever long wait. Then when I got to window waited again. Till I literally had to ask WHY AM I STILL WAITING FOR MY FOOD. as bags were sitting right in front of me.. Total wait time at this McDonald's was like 20 mins. RIDICULOUS..
19095,26,a year ago,3 stars,chicken nuggets had a lot of those chewy fat pieces and was stiff. if ur gonna eat here get a burger or sumn. Fries were tasty tho!
19096,26,2 years ago,4 stars,The line was long but they moved us right along all employees were friendly and courteous the food was fresh and hot I will definitely go back to this McDonald's again
19097,26,a year ago,1 star,Sitting in line at drive thru for 30 minutes.  Inside closed for whatever reason.  If your drive thru has a 30 min wait then why would walk up be closed? The owner of this place is an idiot.
19098,26,4 years ago,1 star,"Drive thru was closed today. 10/9 at 3:45am. Is it still 24 hours if the drive thru is closed and the dining room as well? Park your car and wait, or drive 7 min down the road to the next one....oh the options."
19099,26,2 years ago,1 star,They forgot about me in the drive-thru after asking me to pull to the third window. If I could leave 0 stars I would. Finally went into the store to see my bag sitting on the counter for so long it needed to be remade.
19100,26,6 years ago,1 star,"In a pinch, it's food. My burger was slipped all over the inside of the wrapper and floating in grease. I just ate the dry parts. My husband's chicken sandwich came without any of the toppings and completely drenched in mystery dressing. Fries were super old and had that old grease fishy taste. Sodas (coke and Dr Pepper) were next to flat.

We were starving after a long hot day so, we just ate it and tried not to think about it."
19101,26,4 years ago,1 star,"The Service is bad in special the drivetrue they never give the food correct and management are worse that the bad service that people receive they do not know the meaning of customer service. That McDonald's need to change does managers or give them a good training in customer service, courtesy and Ethical!"
19102,26,7 months ago,5 stars,"One of the better McDonalds.  Fast, accurate, clean."
19103,26,4 years ago,4 stars,"I love McDonalds.  Been in my life all my life.  No bigger disappointment than waiting for my meal and getting lukewarm fries.  This one gave me lukewarm fries after I waited 15 minutes for my meal.  I hold McDonalds to a very high standard and, for me, the fries make the meal.  No exception!!"
19104,26,6 years ago,1 star,I waited 10 minutes in 106ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½F to be told I can only place two orders instead 3 in the drive through. It's 2016 and I'm only able to get blue Powerade instea
19105,26,4 years ago,1 star,"I used my McDonalds app and got some crazy discounts... but I'm still unsatisfied. The food is sad and old. Mr. Happy at the Expo looked like his life was over and didnt know anything about customer service.  The iced coffee was basically milk and creamer minus the coffee. I know this is fast food but damn, you guys didnt even try today."
19106,26,8 months ago,4 stars,Breakfast was good and the meals were delivered to the window accurately.
19107,26,a year ago,2 stars,"Slowest, most under staffed McDonald's I have ever been, everyone honking on the drive trun, people screaming they have been waiting forever, very stressful environment."
19108,26,5 years ago,2 stars,"Manages to allow something to screw up anything Everytime! I came here for 6 days in total. Normally I do not eat at McDonald's but this place is very close to where I'm staying.

They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen. Still gets my order wrong 80 percent of time... What? Asks me what drink I want. Then I just get the cup so why ask me? One day, I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom. Locator and food is gone. Takes me a while to get it sorted out.forgets my drink {again)

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure. Gets little sauce on my clothes, not too bad but Jesus Christ... One night, lot of drinks do not work except for coke (yuk)  few other things not worth mentioning. They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up.

Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink. Clean."
19109,26,4 years ago,5 stars,"Very clean and well organized McDonald's.  McDonald's even has an indoor play area for kids, with a slide. I would highly recommend eating here on a rainy vacation day to allow your children a chance run off a little energy."
19110,26,a year ago,2 stars,Very disappointed that there was no indoor seating. Doors were locked. Drive-thru only. Needed to sit at a table and eat. Decided to eat elsewhere.
19111,26,6 years ago,1 star,I ordered off the screen. It said take number and they will bring it to the table. Well the manager got my order together and got it totally wrong and then stood up there call the number and made me come get it. Did not receive any of my drinks. Went back up there a day the manager was not nice at all. Will not visit again.

19116,26,8 months ago,4 stars,Service was fast but quality of food was disappointing on both trips
19117,26,2 years ago,1 star,Went here to get food got the completely wrong Order in the bag. And the workers want to make 15$+ an hr. How about do your job correctly first.
19118,26,6 years ago,1 star,"So.

19122,26,4 years ago,1 star,Ruse as could be. Opened window and reached out with food while not even looking at us but to something else to his left! We tried to ask for something but he gave the window a shove shut and walked away. No eye contact was made. He didn't even pasture his body toward us. Horrible experience being made to feel invisible!
19123,26,6 years ago,5 stars,"Been to this location several times, only problem is the amount of time waiting for food for dining in & take out orders..... Always made food according to order.... Friendly staff, kind service. Kiosk could use work as the mcpick 2 is not on it and u will pay regular prices if not careful!!!! Otherwise, great!!!"

19129,26,6 years ago,1 star,36 mins to get food and got told it's because we had a large order.   Service was super slow.  People waiting 30-45 mins for food is ridiculous. Oh and by large order it was 4 Happy meals and a couple 2 for 3.  Ugh very disappointed
19130,26,2 years ago,5 stars,"Keith was by far the best fast food employee I have ever come in contact with. He was so generous and helpful, truly deserves a promotion."

19132,26,4 years ago,1 star,"Waste of time. Run. Do not go there. You have been warned. They will waste your time, and mess your order up, three times in a row.... Amazing. Zero Stars is my answer but I had to at least click on one to get pass this part."
19133,26,7 years ago,5 stars,"Fast service, nice play area. Clean store. The manager was out cleaning tables and asking if we needed anything. Play area had some broken equipment, but overall it was one of the best experiences at McDonalds."
19134,26,4 years ago,5 stars,"An awesome McDonald's restaurant that serves food properly prepared,  quickly,  and at the appropriate temperature. This location has that McCafe remodel so it features comfortable niche seating,  charging ports for your tech, and other similar comforts that encourage you to stay and relax for a few minutes."
19135,26,5 years ago,1 star,Horrible I ordered two mcDoubles plain pickles only and on attempt #1 I received two with everything on #2 I received a mcDouble pickles only and a single patty hamburger.attempt #3 I took the hamburger back and received a double hamburger..

19139,26,4 years ago,2 stars,"I visited this establishment as the kfc over the road was a let down like no other.
Only pro here was that I got what I actually ordered however what a game trying to order it.
The lady was not listening at all and just started adding anything and everything to my order.
She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful.. My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen.
My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not.
They only gave me bbq sauces, like who doesn't want ketchup ???
The best thing about the meal was driving out of the establishment never to look back again.

2 start because it was better then kfc."
19140,26,3 years ago,5 stars,Amazing! The best McDonald's food I've ever had. Missing food I had to go back for but well worth it. The food made it okay. I didn't mind the inconvenience.

You could ask for whipped cream. Believe me there coffee tastes much better with butter  and cream in it .  They do not have Stevia . They can make you a keto breakfast. Which is eggs bacon and sausage layered."
19192,26,5 years ago,3 stars,"Understaffed,   slow as a result.    Those that are working,  are courteous and apologetic..  what I don't understand is considering the location,  (Disney area)  that this McDonald's isn't better staffed."

19678,9,3 months ago,1 star,Attention owner: do you even care??? Worst drive-through in all of Florida. S L O W!! Fire everyone including your manager you got the 3 stooges working in there! It is NEVER okay to sit in a drive thru for 20 minutes. Get it together or close your doors!
19679,9,2 months ago,1 star,"Can't change mobile order once placed. I wanted light chocolate in my coffee instead of 6 obese size pumps that drowns the actual taste of coffee and makes it taste extremely sweet. Asked at speaker, window 1, window 2 and the person that made it. Can't do it. And they forgot the hot sauce to my burrito. But this is McDonald's standard."
19680,9,5 days ago,5 stars,"Another aspect that adds to the appeal of McDonald's is the affordability. The menu prices are generally budget-friendly, making it an attractive option for individuals or families looking for a quick and affordable meal. The availability of value meals and combo deals further enhances the value for money."
19681,9,2 months ago,1 star,"constantly miss items. it baffles me. I work fast food. items pop up on a screen, you put them in the bag. its very simple. half the time they put ice in the drink when I ask for no ice, which again, a drink pops up on a screen, and underneath it will say ""no ice"". I'm not really sure if yall just don't care or if this is really that hard."
19682,9,2 weeks ago,1 star,"This is the second time I've came to this McDonald's and they are closed. How you 24 hours but closed. They very rude. Last time they told me they open at 7am in the drive thru, then this morning I was told 6:30am. I come to this one because it's so close to my house. But it seems I'm going have to find another one. This McDonald's need a manager and someone who can be in charge and know how to handle a restaurant. When I come to this McDonald's I always spend $40 or better. Get y'all stuff together"
19683,9,2 months ago,3 stars,"This McDonalds location never staffs an employee at the register to take customers' orders.  This results in all customers having to wait until one of the kitchen staff happens to notice the customers standing at the counter, wishing to place their orders.  The expressions on the faces of the kitchen staff makes it clear that they are irritated at having to interrupt their own work to go over and take customer orders.  This situation has not been corrected for over 6 months, resulting in annoying wait times at what is supposed to be a fast food restaurant.  Hire more staff!!!"
19684,9,3 months ago,1 star,"Says 24/7. Mobile app allows for drive through order. Lights are all on and drive through speaker is active. But nobody is working. Location is closed, no sign, no disabling online orders, nothing."
19685,9,3 months ago,1 star,"Repeatedly missing items. Repeatedly ignoring allergy restrictions such as simple specifics on orders like no onion, no cheese, etc. overnight is horrible. Overnight Manager identified herself as  crystal on 3/5/23 was not helpful and in better terms, an incompetent woman."
19686,9,2 months ago,1 star,I was light headed. I figured let me stop at this McDonald's seeing that its on my way home and close by. I was surprised the shake machine was up and running. I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake. I paid to much money for a little nit of food. My fries had way too much salt on them. Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale. The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top. But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake. I was asked what size I wanted. Of course I was confused. I guess all McDonald's are not the same. I said small. But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu. And I was charged like 5 bucks for it. Smh. Never again. I thought shake size was only small or large.  Not a baby cup size.

I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, the 10 piece nuggets, the fish sandwich and a large iced tea.  Overall the meal is good.  I wish Mcdonald's had more grilled chicken options.  But the meal is quick and cheap.  It got the job done for a good pre workout. The ordering process is kiosk here at this location, so you can wait in line or use the kiosk.  Overall good"
19690,9,5 months ago,2 stars,"They need more happy people in there and people to actually Acknowledge there guest and smile.  It's horrible to feel like your a bother as a customer when your spending your hard earned working money at your restaurant.  NOT GOOD for the business at all, especially when your a regular.  This needs attention Immediately to earn the people's business."
19691,9,3 months ago,1 star,"I hate this McDonald's in the morning. The drive through workers are undertrained and snappy ( there is a difference between a sausage egg mcmuffin and a sausage mcmuffin) I was overcharged the manager (Tim) had me pull up for whatever reason ( I assumed for my overcharge) and never came out the door, I go in after 15 minutes and he acts unresponsive to the guy calling his name( that's how I know what it is) very unprofessional and I will be reaching out to their corporate headquarters about this matter"

19712,9,6 months ago,5 stars,I placed a mobile order to go before I picked up my granddaughter and her friend from middle school. They are always starving after school. Minnie brought my order to the car. I had ordered frozen coke but they didn't have it so she asked me what drink I'd prefer. She also told me to come by and ask for her and she would make it right for me.

19717,9,8 months ago,1 star,"Seriously this place is gone to the dogs. Imagine sitting in line at a fast food restaurant for over 25 minutes to get a burger and fries. Only to receive said Burger and half of the large fry you ordered. Cold limp fries inside of a large container which could have easily fit in a medium container. I'm so sick of these restaurants. Fast food is no longer fast food, the service is subpar, and the food is not even as advertised. I'm literally getting jipped on my food while also waiting for almost 30 minutes to get it."
19718,9,2 months ago,5 stars,There always fast and has my order ready
19719,9,8 months ago,3 stars,Long lines and when did Mikey D's get so expensive? My granddaughter wanted a McFlurry and the ice cream machine wasn't working. Are those machines ever in working order? Alt Spgs McDonald's (on 434 by Walmart) is just as bad with their machine being broken numerous times. Very frustrating.
19720,9,a year ago,1 star,"I'm not one to just say only something negative but for the life of me I can't find anything positive. This branch is the slowest I have ever been to . It never gets my order right , no matter how simple I made it. The burger's condiments were all wrong . The fry's were old as hell and the unsweet tea tasted old and sour.  Definitely no going there again no matter how desperate."

19722,9,7 months ago,3 stars,I felt bad for the employees. They were obviously stressed and the manager seemed to be hiding from the irate customers. It took 20 minutes to get food at 4pm on a Monday.  I was given the wrong sandwich and the fries were hard.
19723,9,a year ago,5 stars,"The manager in the morning is awesome, the older Hispanic woman at the front counter gives exceptional customer service, you can tell she genuinely likes her job and is happy. Food was hot and fresh, and the coffee was just right. Will definitely come back to this one!"
19724,9,10 months ago,1 star,"I never ever go here because it's the most incompetent McDonald's I've ever seen operate. I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how it's really not rocket science but somehow they can't ever get it right. Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it. I would be embarrassed to own this place. Don't go here... I know it's fast food and we shouldn't expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints. Trust me it's worth the drive."

19726,9,8 months ago,2 stars,Cold fries. Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese wasn't melted.  The m&ms were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt out.  $18 is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my daughter. Then subpar at best.

19728,9,a year ago,5 stars,"I usually go to this location, mostly as drive thru. Never have a problem with food, service or wait. This last visit went with the family a group of 7. And order inside the lobby was clean, the staff was friendly.

When he handed the card back to me I said, ""Thank you"" and he said nothing back. I'm not one to usually make a big deal about things. I try not to be ""that person""; however, the way he acted was so unnecessary. Maybe I reminded him of someone, I do not know and never will know.

19734,9,a year ago,5 stars,The line on the drive through is very slow and long. So i decided to go inside. It is friday night. On the door states lobby open untill 12am. They have the doors locked and guys dancing and clowning around. One of them opens the door and tells me they can not take orders in the lobby that drive through is the only way. I asked him may i speak to the shift manager. So he went off and came with one of the guys. Not the manager. He said that the owner of the McDonald's closes early. I recommend people to go elsewhere and not here. Is not worth the time.
19735,9,a year ago,3 stars,It was good. I asked for my stuff to be hot and they did. I feel like regardless at lunch time 12pm stay busy. But this location is so far the best to me. Everybody loves McDonald's and I don't know how some people could do this everyday it's been so pricey it's crazy I can only maybe do it once or twice a month when I have to for work.
19736,9,a year ago,1 star,yall need to step it work I know its stressful but ppl at the window need to look in the bag know its the right thing and repeat it back . I'm happy I don't work there nor do I ever want to if I had to but everytime our order is wrong . and you pay for not what you get its sad we can't afford to pay for sonthing we want. and get ripped off. let's do better guys. if you don't like ur job or have an additide towards ppl just leave it at home or find another job .

19739,9,a year ago,1 star,I felt really sick after eating the fish fillet sandwich. They made me wait a long time at curbside for my sandwich and fries. I assumed it will all be fresh. How wrong was I. Disgusting sandwich and stale fries. Never returning to this location again.
19740,9,4 years ago,1 star,"I ordered a kid's meal that took 14 minutes to receive,  they claim hash browns are not a lunch time item even though it's on the all day breakfast menu claiming it took 12 minutes to cook a hash brown worst location ever"
19741,9,a year ago,1 star,"I came here at around 11pm last night, I ordered a spicy mcchicken medium meal, 2 cheeseburgers, and I asked for the fries fresh. I usually never have an issue when I go to other McDonald's. I order the same thing. Well its not fresh, its called ""to order"". I had to wait , no issues with that, if you want fresh food you typically have to wait for it to be made.  I got my food 8 minutes later and drove off so I could get the food to the house. Almost home, I look in the bag and grab a fry, because mcdonalds fries fresh are freaking delicious. Yeah no, I bit 5 fries all at once and they were soggy and unsalted. Highly disappointed. I tried to call and the phone just rang. I was no longer close to the mcdonalds so I just ordered the same thing at another mcdonalds closer to my destination in winter park. They actually gave me a discount and apologized for my troubles at this mcdonalds. They said they ""understood"". I wont be coming back to this mcdonalds."
19742,9,9 months ago,1 star,The worst place to eat. Go there only if you have 3 hours of leisure time & you dont mind waiting 45 minutes to an hr to be taken care of. Only one manager & too many rookies are uncapable too supply the high demand.
19743,9,10 months ago,3 stars,"The food was alright. But there was almost no one in the front. To ask for something, I had to stand there for almost 10 mins. Maybe they are very short staffed. Idk. Other then that, it seemed okay."

19745,9,a year ago,1 star,"Worst McDonald's in the area. After waiting in line over 20 minutes I finally get to the window, for them to inform me that they were closed. Mind you this was at 1:12 am Saturday morning. The store hours for this location reads closes at 3 a.m not 1:12 a.m!! Clearly management didn't want to serve any more customers due to high volume not because they were closed or closing. Will never go back to this location."
19746,9,2 years ago,1 star,"I live close so I frequent this location. They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they can't even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer. They just take the card, hand it back(most of the times without the receipt) and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word. Head a few miles down A1A and get much better service with a friendlier staff."
19747,9,a year ago,1 star,"The last in a string of bad experiences, I only received half my order and it was still wrong. Genuinely impressive how almost every experience at this location is terrible. Won't be returning"
19748,9,a year ago,5 stars,"With all the issues that almost every business is experiencing...major shortages of both food and employees.. McDonald's seems to be the only place that has managed to keep it all together and do things right! Employees at this location are always efficient, professional and pleasant."
19749,9,3 years ago,1 star,"This has been one of the worst McDonald's I have been too. Not only where the to drive through lines extremely long, but then when we get to the window the person was confused with our order. We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough. The food now left a lot to be desired. French fries were not fresh. They had zero salt. We ordered a 10 piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces. Then on top of that they're old and stale and cold. Needless to say we will never be going there again."
19750,9,3 years ago,4 stars,"Went through the drive through, nothing to complain about. But you can tell that the people who work there do not want to be there. Too many fast food places in this area are like that though. Maybe if they got paid a livable wage they'd be happier. Maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings too? Yeah I think so!"

19752,9,a year ago,1 star,Horrible McDonald's I had visited this McDonald's in the late evening and I was getting cussed out by a employee mopping the floor. How would I supposed to know what area are you mopping without a sign? or just tell me politely to watch my step. I would've kept coming to this McDonald's but if someone is mopping the floor and cussing customers out for walking on the wet floor needs to be fired.
19753,9,3 years ago,2 stars,Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD. I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service. I am not sure if it's because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying. Never has my sauce order been correct. Never. Even when I pay for it. Even when I ask and confirm at the window. It's awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the bag.
19754,9,a year ago,1 star,"Today at approximately 2:20 I asked for a happy meal and asked for the extra french fries in the order and the lady of the dri thru told me give it to me - give it to me now, in a high tone of voice give me the bag and I pack very reluctantly, she was really rude at the time of serving me simply for asking for some fries, now if you could give me a feedback, because it really is not the way to serve the customer"
19755,9,2 years ago,2 stars,"Ok, so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken nuggets, I personally prefer the Wendy's spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh tasting. The McDonald's Spicy Nuggets were Spicy alone, add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you sweat!!! But mine were extremely dry and hard, one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was interesting, I can say I tried them but I was not impressed."
19756,9,2 years ago,2 stars,"food is typically put together well, however curbside is a minimum of 20 minutes once you pull up.

19762,9,2 years ago,2 stars,"Unfortunately today while waiting in line (pulled to the side not in the drive through lane) my frappe was given to the person behind me. She graciously didn't take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it. I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back. I was very confused by this, especially in Covid times. I requested a different drink, no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe. The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again. Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this ï¿½ï"

19764,9,3 years ago,3 stars,O came through the drive though and the guy there was so nice such a pleasure to be around you could tell he definitely cared about his job to the point where I actually gave him a tip at the window he ended up selling me to buying more than what I anticipated then I got home and of course behold my food was incorrect called back spoke to the manager the manager said absolutely come back in and we will correct it which I did and steaks happened came back through the drive-thru a new manager was absolutely wonderful it's how you handle something that makes it worth going back or not. Mistakes happen.
19765,9,5 years ago,4 stars,Always get my food fresh and never mind waiting. This location is so convenient! It is always clean and well maintained inside and out. I only gave 4 stars because the staff is hit or miss. Most of the time there is a very nice crew when I go. Sometimes thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
19766,9,2 years ago,5 stars,Today visit was awful. Food was stiff and luke warm and was missing some items  when I asked for it to be remade Joann the manger argue with me about it. I shouldnt have to argue to get hot food I paid for. Im back to update my review I originally gave my visit a 1 star. I got an email from Bre Williams the general manger she invited my family back and insured this is not how her store operates. Showing care for the customer goes along way. Thank Mrs. Williams for reaching out .
19767,9,3 years ago,5 stars,The workers were incredibly friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere was nice with cute little stools. The digital ordering was a little confusing but overall it was a lovely experience for a McDonald's. Food was good and it hit the spot ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
19768,9,a year ago,1 star,"If I could give it zero stars I would. Your MANAGER is RUDE. Someone ordered breakfast at 1050am, she said no more breakfast. I said ""there is no more breakfast?"" She said out loud, in front of customers ""ends at 1030, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT"" No everyone DOESNT know that, some serve it 24/7. She continued to berate me."
19769,9,5 years ago,4 stars,For fast food this McDonald's is better then average. I think it is probably due to the staff. There is a young girl named Carissa on the Am shift who is excellent. She sees us come in the door and has started our coffee ( we always stop on the way to work). She runs around the restaurant ' topping' off your coffee . We always know when she is working the restaurant is neat and clean. Thanks Carissa for starting our day off with a smile
19770,9,4 years ago,2 stars,"The employees are great but the store manager is just a nightmare. We have coupons with the McDonald's app. The store manager stated that she really hoped that they would stop honoring them, because she was tired of having to ring then up. My wife and I went to the restaurant today and, she said the system was down and she would not accept them at all. I'm going to try and avoid this McDonald's in the near future."
19771,9,2 years ago,1 star,"Super rude. Suppose to be 24 hrs and they acted like ""how dare i eat here"" at like 2am. The worker never even spoke to me just took my card and shut the door on me didn't even get a chance to ask for ketchup."

19784,9,2 years ago,3 stars,3 stars because it's hit or miss whether your order will be correct or not. Or if they give you utensils to actually eat your meal. 100% check your bag before you leave.

For the last 20 years I have purchase the chicken nuggets and the consistency and flavor of the nuggets have not changed, they are just right all the time.

19801,9,2 years ago,4 stars,This place is good for a quick bite but if going through drive through make sure to check order before leaving. They usually get something wrong or forget to put something in your order.
19802,9,2 years ago,1 star,"Worst McDonalds you can possibly find in Florida. If I could give 0 stars that would be more suitable.  They mess up orders they're the only McDonalds in 10 miles that charges extra after 2 pumps of sugar. They dont understand what ""light ice"" means and you're going to have problems if you are trying to use their app for coupons. Please do not allow this McDonalds to ruin your experience and take your money, any McDonalds within 5 miles of this location will provide you the proper service McDonalds is iconic for. Take it from a local, stay far away from this location unless you like waiting ridiculous wait times and feeling cheated out of your money. I have visited this location enough times to understand they are literally the worst location I have been to. This is coming from someone who has been all around central Florida. Please do yourself a favor and go to any other McDonalds to get the experience you deserve."
19803,9,5 years ago,1 star,Cashier Jamesha mocking customers laughing in their face. Moving very slow. At her own beat. Very rude. If I were apart of the Wright family she would definitely not be apart of my family business. I was in drive thru for 25 minutes before parking and coming inside all to witness the foolery which has the line backed up in the first place. However Jamesha is the only one who had a name tag on. Everyone looked over worked and under paid. Very slow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also as I'm writing this review waiting my order it's been 35 minutes here total. The manager sets the tone and she is even slower. Her walk expresses she's lazy
19804,9,5 years ago,2 stars,"I've been going to this location most of my life since it's not far from my home. So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness."
19805,9,5 years ago,1 star,"This location was awful today. They rang up our order wrong, then gave it to us still wrong. Took over 15 min to get our order and we had to ask for our drink cups so we could at least get our drinks while waiting. As we stood there, we saw almost every person have a problem with their orders. The person at the register was messing up every order and the back kept making the wrong things. Worst visit ever."
19806,9,4 years ago,1 star,"Horrible service. Drive thru speaker was not lit up/broken and when I pulled up to order, I was greeted rudely. I asked if I could order at the window and the lady said ""i guess so."" My order was also wrong and the bacon burger came with no bacon. BAD place to visit during a 3rd shift!!"
19807,9,5 years ago,5 stars,The food at this store is always done right. They seem to run a good kitchen. Things are served at the right temp and 99% of the time taste great. Unlike other stores where you've got about a 60% chance of great food.

But when most of the staff are young and  teenage-ish  and rightfully so because age and mindset it a bit understandable.  But not getting right items with orders, or taking longer the should be to get final order is saying something. Having work in the Food & Beverage industry for numerous years in various positions  I Sympathize. When an Iced flavored coffee is made so sweet  with Syrup it's undrinkable that's not acceptable nor is  Appreciated."

19814,9,2 years ago,1 star,"Two employees preparing the food simply didn't wear a mask. I am highly dissatisfied with the effort put into enforcing the wearing of a mask. Why during this pandemic, which has not settled in the least, have you not have had a keen eye on employees in order to safeguard the wellbeing of your customers. It's unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out (With a mask on!) To save lives. Consider this message before you enter this McDonald's (Or any restaurant really) because the meal you get can very well be the deciding factor on whether or not you live in weeks time.

19817,9,4 years ago,2 stars,The food was at McDonald's standards. But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average. Garbage cans overflowing. Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasn't draining. Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher. You couldn't even set your cups down to fill them up.

20471,37,a year ago,1 star,"Disappointing. McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s is my standby for fast food. Normally I get consistent food with decent, sometimes amazing service. I know itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not going to the gourmet but better than waiting at an untested restaurant for more expensive and worse food.

Shrink-flation at its best.  Half filled fries. Soda with no refills. Seriously? Especially now that a combo meal costs $9.

At first I thought it was because the restaurant was newer but after looking at these review"
20472,37,a year ago,5 stars,For the size of the building and play facilities in this McDonald's it's the biggest and the best. If you're looking for customer service not a chance.  You're better off using the kiosks and have patience waiting for your order. I'll recommend this place for the experience only and works with your children.

20475,37,3 weeks ago,4 stars,Nice place for kids to grab quick fries! Close to Hilton Orlando. Just a walking distance if you need something. Next to them thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
20476,37,5 months ago,5 stars,The manager at this store is absolutely outstanding . They just reintroduced the steak bagel and I said what can I change the bread to a McGriddle and she did that without a single question. I even went as far as to ask her if I have the round egg instead of the folded and she jumped right to it and that was fantastic. Try it sometime it's wonderful thank you very much and God bless.
20477,37,2 months ago,5 stars,I put in an order for in-store pickup but didn't realize that the dining room closed at 12. The store manager Emma and the rest of the staff were super accommodating and allowed us into the building and got us our food very quickly. Great customer service!
20478,37,a month ago,3 stars,"Visited the 'world's biggest McDonald's on international drive. Pizza and burger ordered were great, however, had to wait over an hour for food as it was so busy. Pizza also came first, (table delivery) and advised remainder of the order would be delivered shortly. Had to then ask again after around 15 minutes. Order was quickly brought but believe this would have been forgotten if we had not asked. Overall good was fine, but service poor due to being so busy!"

20480,37,a week ago,1 star,We were inside a Walmart McDonald's. My granddaughter has food allergies to egg & dairy. So there are only a few things that she can have. We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead. The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices. Next we ordered apple juice. They were all out of apple juice as well. The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it. A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here. Was not happy with the service here. The food and service times are not the same as it used to be.
20481,37,2 weeks ago,3 stars,"They would do a lot better if they didn't park every car in the drive thru. I know they do this just to make their drive thru time look better to the higher-ups, but it absolutely ridiculous . Simply process your orders faster and give customers their order. Every time I've been parked, I've ended up waiting 5-10 minutes! When I'm only ordering 1 or 2 combos, it makes it a little asinine."
20482,37,4 days ago,1 star,Inside counter served all takeout orders before any dine in customers. Watching customers that ordered over 10mins after myself get theirs first. After getting the food the fries and Big Mac were both ever under cooked. This place shouldn't even be open
20483,37,a month ago,4 stars,Ordered thru the app which was a quick and easy process. Mcflurry and shakes were broken and unavailable at the time of visit. Parked in curbside pickup as drive through line was long. Quickly and accurately received my order.
20484,37,a month ago,1 star,I visited this location 5/5 at 5:07 pm. The 2 young ladies (black and Hispanic) that was handling the food was very rude and rounding their eyes when I asked for fresh fires. When she handled me the fries with an attitude here you go. First and last time visiting this location. Smh customer service training needed asap
20485,37,a month ago,2 stars,"didnt give it 1 star because the food was good but around 4 days ago, i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my McDonald's app code to get the points, i ordered something that was 15 dollars in total and they charged me 31 dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my McDonald's app code to another car order( my card is linked to the app ) and I ended up paying for their food, i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I said, yeah I think that car  is using my code , the guy just said "" is your lucky day go to the next window ""  It was late at night so I didn't give it much thought because I didn't know just by giving your code you can get charged  but next day I got surprised when my account got charged twice. Tried calling but they didn't solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review"
20486,37,2 months ago,1 star,"The manager was rude, I waited for more than 40 minutes, understanding that they were busy.  but everyone who wanted to ask her was stressed.  The worst customer service, additionally, tells me that my refund will be from 5 to 10 days since after 45 minutes waiting.  It only said that there were many orders."
20487,37,a month ago,5 stars,"Friendly, fast service.  Kiosks made it easy to place your order.  The food was delicious and hot.  Very busy location, but hardly no wait. The dining area was nice and clean."
20488,37,a month ago,1 star,"No cashiers/order takers; you must use their self-service kiosk which they have several of. You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table; however, this wasn't the case for us. The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby. We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her line-of-sight. We raised our hand and said, ""that's us"". She saw us, but made no attempt to deliver the food. I don't mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table, but, I'm feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point...we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full-service McDonald's charges. Several people in-store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold, old or not made correctly. This included us...at 1:00 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold, chewy and seemed old. I would think this wouldn't be the case given 1:00 p.m. is during the lunch rush. Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready. Double cheeseburger was made correctly (no mustard or pickles), but bun was not warm/dry and cheese was cold/not melted. 4 managers were in the kitchen (button-up shirts with ties) along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle-paced, leisurely-stroll walk. I worked at McDonald's and Burger King as a teenager and was always told, ""If you got time to lean, you've got time to clean"", and that was during slow/dead times, not lunch rush. I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to (we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 5-10 minutes for fresh ones) was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one."
20489,37,4 weeks ago,2 stars,2 adults ww children breakfast meals. Had to go back to service counter 3 times no eggs in meal. Then again hole in cup hot water everywhere. Then tea bag had hole in so back to counter. Food was cold by time we all sat down to eat. No apologies were given!!!!!
20490,37,2 months ago,1 star,"horrific service. this is NOT the ""world's largest McDonald's"" as people are reviewing on here, this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC. ordering at the drive thru took almost 20 minutes (this did not include waiting for the food), the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him, did not correctly take our order, would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time. i have never in my life been to a McDonald's with worse service. avoid at all costs"
20491,37,a month ago,1 star,Rude and unattentive staff.   They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me.  Not offering any type of assistance or making you feel welcome in any way.  I turned around and walked out the door.
20492,37,2 months ago,2 stars,"Went through the drive-thru and had a pre-order. They rushed us through, they were busy, then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely wrong. Not even worth going back for. It's happened multiple times at this location."
20493,37,3 weeks ago,2 stars,"It was a clean and convenient location, but we were quite disappointed with the service and food we ordered.  We clearly specified using the McDonalds app that we wanted a quarter pounder no mustard, no pickles, no onions.  We received a fully loaded quarter pounder.  AND when the lady delivered our app order to our car, she intentionally stopped far enough so we had to reach backwards to get her food.  She made no effort to offer the food.  She made us get it where she was.  McDonalds needs to review procedures with the staff and seek to improve the customer experience there."
20494,37,2 days ago,5 stars,Always friendly staff. Fairly clean and food to order. Shout out to all workers and managers!
20495,37,5 years ago,2 stars,They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate. They are not very intuitive at all. My order took three times as long to be brought out. Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution. While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered (fish sandwich and something else). Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back.
20496,37,3 months ago,1 star,Rude staff.  Slow food delivery.  Kiosk may save the owner money but it is slow and convoluted.  Not sure why you take a number for table side service and then have to go to counter to pick it up.   Food quality is poor.
20497,37,2 months ago,2 stars,"Atmosphere is cool and unique. Ordered pasta and cheesesteaks. The wait time was forever, service was definitely slow. But it was also Easter and spring break weekend. But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra 30 minutes for our fries and milkshakes. That was weird and frustrating."
20498,37,a week ago,1 star,"Waited to long at drive thru, while other line was moving. App code for deal canceled out and I had to wait for the code to appear again. Crew not helpful at drive thru or inside."

20500,37,4 years ago,3 stars,"5-30-19 - On the way back from all day at Universal Island of Adventures, so decided on a cheaper meal to end the night. Had dinner with family here. Busy night, but able to order our meals from the auto screens instead of counter, and pay. Cool, since in Georgia they haven't caught on at many yet. Ordered several meals and customized my Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich meal to include bacon, pickles, and cheese, and a large fry. Service was great for me. They managed to work around us and keep things clean in the eating areas and bathrooms. Enjoyed the experience. Went back for dessert, but paid at the counter, and let them know we appreciated the service."

20504,37,6 months ago,5 stars,Being in the area this is a must see place. Had a great meal overall. It was busy but got almost all our food very quick but the pizza. Quite understandable that the pizza would take longer but the only thing is that by the time it arrived my fries were almost cold. No big deal but they should keep that in mind. Other than that the pizza was great and service was good. Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve worked McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
20505,37,a year ago,3 stars,"Very busy drive thru. Cars were lined up literally around the building from pick up windows all the way to the front on the restaurant facing International Drive. Informed at the window that they were out of food items we ordered, and asked if we can order something else.

However, even though we had a big order everything was in the bag. The food were also hot and fresh."
20506,37,2 weeks ago,2 stars,The kids wanted it ...the kids loved it they had nuggets and fries....it's McDonald's...the service at drive through is borderline passive aggressive  but you can't complain well it's like say your order and here's your meal...lol but it's McDonald's
20507,37,3 years ago,2 stars,"Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is horrible, no one is taken the in house orders, only drive thru is being taken care of, I've been standing here for 27 minutes until I got to put in my order, not a word said to me about the wait, only 3 of the 8 desserts have labels. Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken. After receiving my order McDonald's employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen, One customer said she didn't know how to use it so she was told by the McDonald's employee to continue to wait. I finally got my order after 39 minutes after coming in through the door."
20508,37,2 months ago,1 star,Went through the drive-thru and ordered my food and when it got to the window only charged  for one meal and I had asked for two then had told me to pull over to the side and waited for a long time that forgotten about me. So I had to go back in and tell them about my order. And when I went back to let them know they  gave me look like I was bothering. I've never apologized ....poor management!!
20509,37,8 months ago,2 stars,"This morning 10/11/2022, went through the drive thru for my breakfast.  Two things medium Hot mocha plain and sausage mcmuffin. Paid and advanced to the next window.  Here is where things went wrong!
The blue shirt manager  ( last name begin with an A) on duty Had a serious attitude.  She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order. She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order. I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee . She said the there is no coffee on the order. I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me. Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP.  Which is her job .
Her Words loud and clear
""FOR GOD SAKE""
I know I only spent a few dollars but IT don't justify getting attitude because this is your job.
I ask for a refund.."
20510,37,a month ago,1 star,"Arrived at the McDonald's at 10:20PM, and the posted hours said the location was open until 12:00AM. An employee locked the door and barricaded it with a trash bin and didn't let us in until we mobile ordered, although another employee seemed confused by this. Another employee was also telling people that the lobby was closed (again, even though the hours stated that the location would be open until 12AM). Additionally, while this happened, there were at least a dozen people sitting down and eating, and there were empty tables."

This one has two separate planes to order) The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the vehicles, when paying we were barely acknowledged, but the worse was to come. When at the next window to get our food.. the person did not even look at me.. literally just handed a bag out the window, then handed the drink out the same way..partially angled down towards me. Better yet, check out the new crispy chicken deluxe. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
20512,37,4 years ago,5 stars,We visited this while on a vacation to Orlando with our team. What an experience. There's a lot of different food options including PIZZA! The place is amazing. If you are ever in or near the Orlando area it is absolutely worth the time to stop in and see this place. Unbelievable.
20513,37,3 months ago,5 stars,"Great Mcdonalds! Really love the clean store, the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets. The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders. Highly recommend this store if you're in the area. The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat. Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive (the road) is pretty interesting at times. In conclusion, I rate this McDonald's 5/5 and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs."
20514,37,5 months ago,1 star,"Hours are inaccurate, they close the dining room before 11:00, not midnight as is posted on their doors. The tea also has the distinct taste of coffee, which makes it taste like burnt tea....gross......"

I fully recommend to visit this place."

20545,37,7 months ago,1 star,Went to this location around 3am and placed an order through the app. Waited in the drive thru for 20+ minutes with other cars to then be told they are closed only. The manager refused to refund my order and also refused to give me her name. The manager that works there during the night should not be in management and lacks customer service skills along with the other 3 employees that refused to acknowledge us at the drive thru window. This location needs training from corporate and should not have the open 24 hours a day signs on their windows. Very disappointed in my experience at this McDonald's.
20546,37,3 months ago,5 stars,Quick and easy using the order yourself tower. Fish ole sandwich was delicious. Thank you.

20555,37,a year ago,3 stars,The international drive McDonalds looks great but the play place was closed - this was the reason for bringing my kids - so this was a HUGE let down; it was 7pm on a Sunday night when we went in the middle of a tourist city! Too bad ï¿½

20558,37,5 months ago,5 stars,"This location offers pizza, pasta, and more. It has an arcade on the 2nd floor that acts as the play area. This McDonald's is the largest McDonald's and is close to both amusement parks. Therefore, it will always be a go-to stop for me on vacation. The pizza at McDonald's is freshly baked to perfection by a McPit Master"
20559,37,2 months ago,1 star,The worst I know it's fast food but corp needs to straighten this place out bad service bad attitudes for being so tourist friendly area this was the least friendly
20560,37,7 months ago,2 stars,"They messed my order up 2 times. They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still raw. They have nasty attitudes. You have to use the kiosk to place your order. There is no more service with a smile. An update I now have food poisoning form the raw/ undercooked chicken I was served yesterday. Don't eat here, I will never come back here ever again. My reviews have been see by over 100,500 people."
20561,37,a year ago,5 stars,"Everything was great!  Food was good and fresh.  Place was clean.  All the employees were very nice to us and attentive.  Especially Patrick on the second floor, he was amazing.  Kept everything clean the whole time, ask us how we were a few time and was very kind and polite the whole time, and takes very seriously his duties.  Me and my kids enjoy our time a lot."
20562,37,a year ago,4 stars,Little more expensive than your average McDonalds but I suppose that is to be expected due to the location. One nice benefit is that they do accept the coupons in the McDonald's app.

20565,37,11 months ago,1 star,"This place really should be shut down. If they can't deliver in customer service just close.  I ordered with them and waited for 45 minutes.  I asked them after 10 minutes about my order and they said it's coming up.  After 20 minutes I ask again about my order and the supervisor tells me ""one at a time, I can't skip your order in front of other people"".  She then proceeds to continue skipping my order to serve other people.  At 45 minutes I asked again and she finds my order on a table and says to her coworker they never made it.   Nobody gave an apology or acknowledged they were in the wrong.  If you can't run a restaurant correctly then please just shut down.  There are countless pictures on their reviews of cars piling up and terrible customer service."

20571,37,7 months ago,5 stars,"Hello everyone.  First, I have to say that I have not been to McDonald's in forever!! With that being said,  I went through the drive thru because I didn't want to get out.  The young man who took my order was kind,  that was the first window.  2nd window,  a whole other story.  Drive up, and right off the bat, this young lady looks mad that she is even working.  You know,  at least fake that you are Blessed to even have a job.  I was scared to ask her for a cup holder, but I did any way,  lol.  I had the BigMac Meal and remember like I said I had not been in forever.... I DEVOURED THAT BIG MAC, it Was fresh, and so were the fries. I also had a Fish sandwich.  So yes I recommend."

20573,37,5 months ago,2 stars,"They took 17 minutes for my McChicken which feels like it wouldn't take that long, and then they forgot my lettuce on it and the fries were cold, I'm wanting to bet that if I went again it would be better, but with most options out of stock I can't recommend going"

Destiny was super helpful and even overheard us talking about asking for extra syrup for the pancakes and went and got it for us without us even having to ask. Customer service sometimes seems like a thing of the past but not at this McDonald's. Also, when I spoke to the manager about the great experience he was very nice as well. Great McDonald's! All McDonald's should be modeled after this one. Thank you guys!!!"

20584,37,8 months ago,1 star,This review is about the staff at this location. I visited this McDonalds 09/24 around 6:30pm to pick it up my food. My wife did another mobile order and I just arrived and tried to explain to the manager (I think she was) I have another order that was not on the screen. She was rude and answer ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½one order at the timeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of course the first order arrived and I was still standing waiting for the other one more than 15 min. Another friendly Girl (Danisha I thinks was her name tried to help me out) and the manager stopped her and sent to carry other stuff in the back. She was in charge for drive thru and one Spanish customer was making an order. Danisha asked her to help and she said I canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t. I was shocked about this

20588,37,7 months ago,1 star,"Hawaiian Court location -
Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the ""Fast Food"" label.
From order to recieving the food, it took 42mins, and even then the order came out wrong.
There was one manager, one fry cook and one burger cook, trying to complete a dinner time rush, yet there were 3 cleaning staff going round cleaning 1 table every 20mins or so.
This team could really do with some logistical training on how to get orders out efficiently and on time, because this really was a poor attempt at ""fast food""."

Guy who brought the food really didn't wanna talk or answer the question because he all but ran to the back. Again drive thru wasn't busy and instead had maybe 3 families and 3 singles. And the single people had their food already.

20595,37,a year ago,1 star,"RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! We just went through the drive through and the teen girl sounded like she was depressed and going to jump.

We ordered 2 doubles, 2 chicken, 1 large fries and 2 large drinks. Everything, every-thing tasted hard like cardboard. The fries were extremely hot and hard and crunchy like stones. Both the chicken and doubles had no - no - no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard. For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke, both were large size which they did not get right the first time. Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor.

The food was over dry and tasteless. The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday's old food..if not last weeks old junk..

It's almost a guarantee your food will taste horrible And your money wasted.. save yourself time and go somewhere else you will be glad you did!"

20598,37,9 months ago,3 stars,"Disappointing. The pictures of the food is inaccurate. Meals showing you get hashbrowns show no hashbrowns when you begin the order. Hashbrowns themselves ordered separately show two but you get one.

20605,37,10 months ago,5 stars,"My family and I stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our way home from a mini vacation.

I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown.

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table. I noticed I didn't have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal. I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed.

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn't on the tray either.
I let her know and she apologized, then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns, which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now. She comped a free hashbrown.
She was such a pleasant person to deal with.  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 20/10

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn't her usual location and she is a General Manager.

She took care of evryone around us, with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face, which is a rare occasion.

I hope she gets the recognition she deserves, and a promotion or raise. She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one. It's funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up."

Employees wandering the store on their phones and ignoring customers. When asked for napkins an employee went thru two other employees instead of just handing customer napkins. No organization at all and rude as can be. Gave me diet soda, when I asked for regular they rolled their eyes. I understand it's busy but this place could be handled better. Go anywhere but here."

The drive-thru was open, but it was exceedingly slow. The service was poor, and the products we ordered were sub-par (even for McDonald's standards, which is saying something). We ended up just throwing some of it away. I typically do not leave negative reviews. I am hoping that they were just short-staffed the night we went."
20612,37,11 months ago,1 star,"Although conveniently located to several hotels, the hour wait to get my order shows incapability to handle the extra patronage.

20614,37,a year ago,1 star,@McDonald's corporate you need to investigate this location immediately. The customer service is highly lacking and I'm positive the management of that location is damaging your brand. Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible. We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response. We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited. Zero response. We spoke multiple times. No reaponse. No one greeted us. No one asked us to wait. Nothing. Radio silence. Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder. Needless to say we drove away without making an order. It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald's.
20615,37,10 months ago,1 star,"We had a great dat at SeaWorld with the gkids and decided to swing by and get ice cream for them on the way home.  Well we get there and there is a line out the door because only one of the 6+/- kiosks are open.  We wait in line for 30min and as my wife gets to order they shut it down to only drive thru.   Absolutely horrible customer service and the lack of care from the manager was disgusting and extremely disappointing!  Never would I say this company is a favorite of mine, but now, I never plan to visit again!!!!!"

20627,37,a year ago,1 star,I walked in the door with my son in-law to order inside because it said dining room open till 3am.  It was 1am 3-22-2022.  We went to every kiosk none working.  We walked up to register.  A woman back towards the back yelled out that they were closed.   Well we walked out got in our van pulled up to drive through.    Nobody responded.  We turned off engine a waited a bit.  Nobody.  We left and visited Wendy's drive thru.
20628,37,a year ago,1 star,"25-30 min wait for food and order wasn't even correct. Other people told me they'd waited an hour. Also some of the most unhappy theme-park-bound families you're ever going to see in this place. Overall a disaster, consider starving instead."

20630,37,5 years ago,1 star,"Literally waited 20 minutes. The sign says to ""place tent on table and relax. Your delicious food is on its way"" but it wasn't even delivered to us."
20631,37,a year ago,1 star,"rude customers, half the kiosk malfunction and staff is not trained to help if it malfunctions, Managers are so busy solving issues with equipment they cant manage the staff. High turnover, homeless people camping out inside. Overall way to crowded and overpriced travel the extra mile and go to the next McDonald."
20632,37,7 months ago,1 star,With the size of the big breakfast that would starve a child. Maybe you should start calling it baby breakfast. If you don't get cakes with it then you have over half a tray of just a bite of eggs two small strips of bacon and a dry/hard biscuit. I think a total of six bites and two minutes with phone in hand while eating and it was gone. There goes almost ten bucks.
20633,37,a year ago,1 star,"Zero starts!
All tables were unattended. They were all dirty. Food took a while. Manager was yelling at staff to hurry up with food. I stood for a few minutes ready to place my order. I was the next client. No one. I mean. Not a soul greeted me, acknowledge my presence or anything. Not even an exchange of words when I got my food (which I had to order online from inside the restaurant because no one was there to help me). Not a you're welcome when I said thanks. Nothing!!! I would not come here again."
20634,37,a year ago,1 star,Absolutely horrible place. After waiting 40 minutes we had to ask how much longer. The first lady looked at the orders then ignored me. The manager finally came and couldn't even find my order. The workers were just yelling over each other and at costumers. Never got all our food and was upset with this place we just had to leave. Will never go back and we frequently are in Orlando.

20638,37,a year ago,1 star,"I placed an order through the 'improved' kiosk system and over 15 minutes later had to inquire about it. Turns out the order had been completed but staff were 'busy with other dutys'; so it just sat there. So much for customer service. However, the shift leader did apologize. Honestly, I'd rather have hot food. And once in my vehicle, I discovered the order was not even correct. Failure level = complete.
My first time in a McDonald's in almost 10 years. Now I remember why. Given the choice, I have no need to return to McDonald's; ever."

20643,37,2 years ago,1 star,"I really don't want to be ""that guy"" and I typically do not leave bad reviews. But this experience this morning was absolutely HORRIBLE! I waited 24 min for apple pies that I know for a fact do not take that long to cook. Restaurant looked to be short staffed which I understand and there was an employee there that was fairly new it seemed which was also fine. My issue came with the TWO managers that were ""taking care of the guests"". Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was about. I deduced that I was waiting for pies because I heard the crew talking about it. These 2 managers were more concerned about what they were doing later and how one typically doesn't work weekends. Did not Apologize or attempt to communicate anything to any guests. The worse part is as the food finally came up they tossed my bag to me and walked away. I hop that this is not typically how business is done there but my goodness..."

20646,37,a year ago,1 star,"Massively understaffed. 25+ min wait for food. Also got the order wrong.

20648,37,2 years ago,5 stars,Visiting from out of town. I was very impressed with the manager Stephanie. She really stood out to me today because she was working very hard and every customer that came her way she made sure she assisted them with out rushing them even though they were very busy. She also took the time to pick up in lobby to keep the inside looking good. Thanks for that experience today Step!
20649,37,a year ago,1 star,They will NOT TAKE YOUR ORDER inside UNLESS you use their self serve kiosk. I shouldnt have to say I cannot see the screen for someone to take an order. Why have the front counter if its self checkout at ALL times. It is not busy. I just left and went to get food from someone else. Why is that the only way to order. I work and live near here but will definitely not be back nor my coworkers.
20650,37,a year ago,5 stars,"Always call here after visiting Seaworld. It's half the price of the food in Seaworld.

20653,37,a year ago,1 star,Ordered using their self serve machines. Sat at the table as per the instructions on the machine. Waited 15 minutes. No food.

20654,37,a year ago,1 star,"Easily the worst fast food experience. My girlfriend and I were feeling sick from needing to eat something and stopped here. Location is 24hr but the doors were locked to stop ppl coming in. A customer let us in and we were greeted to customers demanding refunds, ridiculous wait times, and them being out of many items. Staff is very rude and condescending, and the place is very poorly managed."

20656,37,2 years ago,2 stars,Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their food. Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so slow. The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late 70's bring the food out. She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock in. No offense she was a sweet heart just worried.
20657,37,a year ago,5 stars,"Breana on the amusements kiosk has made our evening, giving her time to explain loading the amusement cards up, really kind and helpful and nothing was rushed or too much trouble, my children (5&2) really loved her and all the way home said how nice she was.

We've had bad experiences in this mcdonalds (long waits for happy meals etc) but i think she easily changed those for us today.
I hope she gets recognised for how good she's been."

20659,37,a year ago,1 star,"Do not eat here, save yourself, time and money. I ordered here 5 times in a month and every time it was wrong. you would think I would learn. I tried to make it easy on them and ordered my burgers plain. Thinking the less work the better. Nope some how plain means ketchup only. Another time they put tartar sauce on my cheese burger. The managers tell you if you have a problem to just call the McD's number to complain. I am local so I have choices to eat at other places. You know what Wendy's is sounding a lot better these days. It's not even a short staff problem, its a I don't care problem. I must be a slow learner but trust me this McD ruined it for all others. losing my $45 order each trip wont hurt then in the short term. But over a long time it will and will make sure I let others know to for go McD and go somewhere else. STAY AWAY!"

20671,37,a year ago,3 stars,"The staff could have been a little more attentive to people when they have questions. Instead they were all standing there talking not acknowledging people if they had a question including me. I had a question about the new disney 50th toys, whether I could buy them individually or only in the happy meal and she was like annoyed that I asked. One gentleman wanted to order at the counter and they just yelled from behind the counters you have to place your order at the kiosk, so he walked away. He wanted to pay cash and didn't know how to do it on the kiosk, but they didn't want to be bothered.

20676,37,a year ago,5 stars,Some of the negative reviews I'm seeing might be for other I-Drive locations. This one on the south end located near Sea World is always pretty good. It's a well run establishment and seems a little more upscale than the others in the area. Service is friendly although a bit on the slow side on my most recent visit but the Drive Thru was packed as this was on a Saturday night during a busy time of season in Orlando.
20677,37,a year ago,5 stars,"Updated review 2022: This really is a great McDonald's. Maybe if you don't appreciate it, you haven't been around. The grounds are clean, I saw the manager (Chris) picking up trash around the store. They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant. A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE ya'll. It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby, I think service is pretty fast. (2019 Review) I went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always hot, place clean and staff prompt and courteous. Got a fabulous greeting Memorial Day morning."

THEN I PROCEEDED TO CALL THE NEXT MORNING AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER, EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED TOLD HER ID LIKE THE MANAGER NAME FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE TO REPORT IT TO COORPRATE, SHE THEN TOO HUNG UP IN MY FACE TOO!!!

THESE ARE THR MANAGERS ACTING LIKE THAT ? IM FAR BEYOND DISSAPOINTED AND I WILL BE STILL REACHING OUT TO COORPRATE.  THEY DONT DESERVE THEIR JOBS AT ALL, SOMONE ELSE WOULD REALLY NEED THAT JOB AND TREAT THE CUSTOMERS PROPER ."

We got turned away at the drive thru because they stated, ""we are short staffed and really busy, we can't take any more orders for 20 minutes"" and when I asked if I could wait in the drive thru, they told me no because the drive thru is timed and it would time out. I understand being short staffed and running behind on orders, thats understandable, but telling people you're not taking orders for the next 20 minutes.. I mean come on, I am not sure who is managing this location but turning away business? Seems like a poor business practice to me. This happened on 10/17 at 1030 by the way."

I dont get ti eat breakfast out very often so this was a treat for me ad the food was great.
20696,37,a year ago,3 stars,This mc Donald's is self order only. And the self order board wasn't working properly? So it made for a lengthy wait. They don't have any cash sale lines? It seems they only want drive through business.  As far as the food.....well you know what your gonna get here!

But the manager on duty this morning, when asked about the seating simply waved my wife off and shooed her away without even taking her cell phone from her ear...   shameful...  we just wanted to have a quick bite before getting on the road on the tail of the tropical storm.

When I finally got my food, the crispy chicken sandwich tasted stale, the texture was very chewy and not crisp at all; on top of that, I wasn't asked if I wanted any ketchup or sauces, the sandwich didn't have a drop of mayonnaise or anything on it, just oddly dry pickles, and a soggy bun. I had to park and go inside to get condiments. As has become almost expected with the McDonald's experience, the soda tasted like sanitizer. Never again at this location.
I only stop at McDonald's if I am blindingly hungry, on the verge of passing out, and still my past 3 experiences at three locations around Orlando have been disgusting.

Update: Got food poisoning, and this is the last thing I ate."

20707,37,6 years ago,1 star,Awful. 2AM visit. Only two workers. Took 30 minutes with nobody in line as the cashier had to run food out to cars waiting too long in drive through. Fries were undercooked.

20710,37,3 years ago,5 stars,"Visited a few days after Christmas, it was a quick walk from our  hotel. Considering the amount of people that were ordering, our food came out quick. They forgot some items and they were very apologetic and got the rest of our order right away."
20711,37,3 months ago,1 star,Literally the worst McDonald's I've ever been to
20712,37,a year ago,5 stars,Fries and nuggets were hot and fresh.  I got the family share about 40 nuggets 40 nuggets and 2 large fries. Plus the 20% off with mobile app. Great deal.

A male associate asked if he could take our tray when we were finished. The staff is impressive and the remodel looks refreshing"
20716,37,a year ago,5 stars,"McDonald's is my favorite restaurant of all. My dad or mom always order something we like. Mine is the double cheeseburger with no pickles. In Saturdays and mostly Fridays, we get those burgers for dinner. Like to see McDonald's keeping up the good work!"
20717,37,3 years ago,1 star,"We waited for 50 minutes in the drive through. The line moved at the beginning, but then stopped completely near the order box. Because of the way the cars are channeled through a curbed path we couldn't escape. We were trapped and had no choice but to sit and wait. It was very frustrating. The order we received was correct but we didn't get any apology or explanation. We'll Mark this location on the map and never go here again."
20718,37,2 years ago,1 star,"Thank you for the cold breakfast. Made me wait almost 40 minutes. Families got theirs before my lil sandwich and coffee. They just forgot about my meal and let it sit. Only thing warm was the coffee,barely.

None of our order was correct and it was pouring rain so I did not want to go back through the slow drive thru. I mean McDonald's is what it is, but people go there for quick and convenient and those components were def missing on this particular visit. ï¿½ï"
20721,37,a year ago,1 star,"I waited 20 minutes until I got my food but the order was completely wrong. I ordered two double cheeseburgers and I got one with two patties and a glob of ketchup on it. The other just had a party with two dry pieces of bread on it. The fries were colder than a dead body in a freezer. What an absolute joke of a kitchen staff. Just a bunch of high school dropouts that cant even make a sandwhich correctly. If your reading this, just go buy some burgers and bread and make one yourself."

20724,37,2 years ago,2 stars,They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift. This location seems to be very popular at night and yet the management has barely anyone back there making orders. There was a giant mob waiting at the register's for their orders. Be smarter with your manning.
20725,37,a year ago,1 star,"Rudest staff ever. I literally just wanted water, I asked how to get water and this lady just muttered something and pointed somewhere. So I asked another employee and was straight up ignored. Tear this place down, it ain't working."
20726,37,10 months ago,1 star,"Very rude employee taking orders"" slammed the window in my face and left and  didn't charge me, also called the manager and the manager was worst than the employee, beware of this location this people are rude and very far from being polite- horrible experience, staffsocks."
20727,37,3 years ago,3 stars,Took forever to get our food every day we were there this week when they got very busy. One night we were there for almost an hour waiting in a crowd. I feel like they might have been understaffed because they weren't working quickly. Everything was good and correct but they ran out of one items I ordered so they replaced it with a different flavor.
20728,37,10 months ago,1 star,Took over half an hour to received food and it was stone cold staff looked demoralise when asked a member of staff about my food she just looked at me and walked away would never go there again spent over $90 dollars for poor service and food.
20729,37,3 years ago,5 stars,"Best McDonalds in the area. Great coffee, modern decor, clean. Wifi. Quickest service. Friendly and helpfull staff."
20730,37,3 years ago,4 stars,I personally haven't had any issues with this location. In the 2 years I've lived close by there have been 2 times where the drive through was majorly backed up and something was clearly wrong. But of maybe 100 trips in the last few years I've had 95% good service and fresh food.

20732,37,a year ago,1 star,Sometimes high tech doesn't mean faster. Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously. Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drive-thru. Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food. They had just mopped with 20+ customers inside so that was a safety hazard. Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor.
20733,37,4 years ago,1 star,Service at this place is a joke. Sat in the drive threw for 20 minutes waiting of my food. The tea is bad 60 percent of the time. I believe this falls directly on management. As there are always new employees there. Most times having poor attitudes. Also I have never once been suggested a pie. I don't even bother pointing it out as it would only take longer. And probably be un edible. I only stop in there maybe once a month when I'm in a bind.
20734,37,a year ago,3 stars,I came here on my way to a meeting in the convention center. I had 20 minutes to be where I needed to be so I figured I would swing by this McDonald's and grab some food. Boy was that a mistake. I arrived at this McDonald's at 11:45. I did not order my food at the drive-thru window until 10 minutes after 12:00. By the time I actually got my food it was closer to 12:30. This has to be the absolute slowest McDonald's in the history of any restaurant in the world. It has double drive throughs and they seem to prefer the inside Lane to the outside lane. They were taking the orders of customers on the inside line too if not three to one. Not exactly sure what was going on inside the building. But they were slower than molasses. I understand that there is issues right now with finding employees for a little bit of prep work would have sped up the process a little bit. That's why I gave them three stars instead of one.
20735,37,10 months ago,5 stars,They have a arcade and place to play for kids of all ages staff swerves you and very helpful definitely my go to place when In Florida
20736,37,5 years ago,1 star,"I'll start with the positive: The food I received was the correct order and it was hot. The bad: What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip ended up being almost 40 because they were severely understaffed, and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone. Maybe they're better during the day, but definitely stay away from the midnight shift if you're looking to get in and out."

20742,37,a year ago,1 star,OMG!!!...The WORST McDonald's I have EVER been in. Orders were on the board and they were just standing around like the had nothing to do. Drive thru was closed so everyone had to come inside to place their order. This was my first and last time I will NEVER eat at this location. No sense of urgency from the manager on duty as well!!!

20746,37,a year ago,2 stars,I would give 3.5 stars for the sugar free caramel iced coffee and 1 star for the sausage burritos. The burritos were very small half the normal size and very little filling or cheese inside. It's been a year since I had a sausage burrito and McDonald's has definitely gone downhill. Prices are higher for the burrito and you get less food for the money.
20747,37,2 years ago,1 star,"Waited almost 30 minutes to get my food, while people with bigger orders that came after me, got their food. When asked what was taking so long, they said they are working on the order, then followed by asking me what my order was. After wards, had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was, had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave. The worst experience ever."
20748,37,2 years ago,5 stars,Had a slight issue ordering. Inform the manager that they're ordering system was not working right. They jumped on it right away to correct the problem with getting it involved. Super clean and friendly store.
20749,37,4 years ago,1 star,"Visited 3 times over a week during a conference. This place is a shambles. The self-ordering system seems good until you realize that everything after is shambolic. Twice out of those 3 times it's taken more than 30 minutes to get a simple order, and it's not even been busy. The staff (especially the manager Martha) is aggressive and disengaged. Overall a truly terrible 'fast' food location."

Then I pulled up to receive my order I was given my drinks but was missing the one from my Happy Meal order as I asked for it and the person at the window looked at me like what was I talking about I said that i am missing a drink and again he looked at me like I was tring to get something again i mentioned that i have 3 orders with a beverage and a frap but i am still missing one then he began to say ok it is coming just pull forward to the next window as i pulled forward they brought me my items and still no drink and was still missing items again they looked at me like i did not know what i was saying and then finally got my HM drink but i was still missing items was told they are in the oven again waited 10 min with no one coming to the window to inform me of the wait I went to the window where thire was a person and again he was confused on why i was still in there line waiting on food, then the manger came to the window asking what is the problem I said I am still missing my apple pies he being to tell me they are in the oven and it takes 10 min I asked am i still waiting at the other window or am i pulling to a number lane he said no next window so I pull back up and wait another 7 more min I have now been waiting 20 min for my items.  If it was communicated that the wait will be a long wait, I would not have felt forgotten at the window."
20752,37,3 years ago,5 stars,"Very nice, clean establishment. The staff was efficient and worked diligently to provide for our every need. My family and I are visiting from out of town.

I greatly appreciate the atmosphere they provide for their customers."

Location is good. Restaurant is clean.  Employees are nice. Orders are accurate.  Ordering Keosks are cool.  Well laid out & up to date . . . but prepare to wait.  This place is busy beyond repair.  Drive through stacked (at least 9 cars waiting with both wait stalls full.  For the last hour, 8+ people lined up inside with 2 of the 4 kiosks in use.  Prepare for minimum 30 minutes inside."

Ask what the hell was going on and the cow behind the counter said ""oh our bun toaster is broken"".  Didn't say that at the window!! This is an I DRIVE location. Absolutely ridiculous. Stay away. What a waste."
20755,37,3 years ago,4 stars,Food was decent. Cashier had difficulties with card in drive thru saying machine was asking for pin. Odd. Large order but smoothies three quarters of way filled. Filled but looked like ice and concentrate added. They did remake it which turned out fine.

20761,37,4 years ago,3 stars,The team had no personality and had even had one employee on his cell phone while making orders.  The food I got had the fries lukewarm yet the burgers were fine.  They were more concerned with talking with themselves and not the customer.  Outside of that the place was clean and recieved my order in a quickly manner
20762,37,2 years ago,1 star,"One of the worse McDonalds I have ever been to.  There is no welcomes or thank you.  Service treats you like you are a problem for them, ie: the server placed the food on front of the customer and started to walk off, the customer said what about my drink.  The server rolled her eyes walked away, brought the drink back reached through the screen put the drink down and walked away.  No I am sorry, no have a nice day.  For me it took over 7 minutes to just get a milkshake.  Never Again for me."
20763,37,4 years ago,5 stars,Good fast location. They had a third window for you to pull forward to keep the line moving through the drive thru instead of having someone walk out to your car. It was super convenient and it did seem to save time. We will probably stop by this location again before our trip it over. You can't really go wrong with $1 cheeseburgers.

20765,37,a year ago,1 star,"To whom it may concern. Your curb at the entrance of Hawian Bvld at International Drive is dangerous to cars turning right to park. The curb extends to far out to the drive and is blind to drivers in SUVs are high sitting vehicles. I can tell by the damage to the curb, that I'm not the first to experience this and damaged was caused. As a suggestion you may want to paint the curb bright red or install a Yellow caution post to alert drivers. The right think to do would be to correct it."
20766,37,2 years ago,4 stars,"No wait in drive thru line. They got the order right. Fries were nice and hot and the staff was respectful. I did not five stars because the girl at the drive thru struggled to understand me, english was not her native language. She tried though and it all worked out. I got my correct order and in a timely manner."
20767,37,a year ago,5 stars,"It is very clean inside, great staff. I always go inside and order take out. They do everything super fast."
20768,37,3 years ago,1 star,I could not recommend this place. We pulled up to the drive thru at 10:48 pm and the guy behind the speaker said just go ahead with your order with the most unpleasant tone. When I asked if I could have just a sec he replied again in an unpleasant tone well we close in 2 mins. So clearly they didn't want our business and something tells meet they won't want yours. Save your time and go elsewhere.
20769,37,a year ago,5 stars,The cleanest nicest McDonald's ever! The staff are so welcoming and helpful and great with the kids after a long tired day! Thank you.

He said he can substitute for cookies. 15 minutes later I had my order with cookies and still no apple pie. Frustrating. Their soft drinks are always hit or miss as well because the balance of syrup and water is never correct
20772,37,2 years ago,5 stars,We're here the other night about 2:00 a.m. they're very kind and considerate the fries were a little late so they offered me an extra set plus the ones that were not bad in my opinion but may have been a minute older so thanks to them and their service and tasty food

The lady working inside was annoyed that I was trying to get service at 445 and rolled her eyes when I pointed out incorrect details. Need to fix their information."
20774,37,3 years ago,1 star,"Absolutely the slowest service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  Me and my 3 friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals.  After 45 minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food.  There was one person working fries, one cook, on manager assisting the cook, and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers.  The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on.  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers. Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the. After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20+ minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager. He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que.  So he had no idea what any of us ordered. We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us 10 minutes later. All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty.   All the employees including the manager didn't even look 18 years old. They were definitely under trained, mis managed, and probably under staffed."
20775,37,4 years ago,5 stars,"Nothing bad to say here! We grabbed some quick breakfast before heading to the parks. We opted to use the digital checkout to place our order which is pretty cool and gives plenty of options to what you order. It also seems to give you a little more time to order. The place was very clean and modern in design. We didn't interact too much with staff but the little we did, they seemed very nice and helpful. Although not used this time by us, I did notice a cart specifically for sauces, seasonings, etc right behind the counter for quick access when asked.. the location was pretty good despite being off a busy road so that didny pose any issues. Overall a pretty food McDonalds experience!"

20785,37,2 years ago,1 star,"This place was a mess. They took FOREVER to serve the few people they had. A guy dropped a spatula. I was freaking out. They would take counter order cause the manager said ""When we are done in the back."" So upset with this service."
20786,37,2 years ago,4 stars,"Very busy usually, fresh hot food, fried typically don't have salt on them have been multiple times before with the same issue. Prices also higher than other mcdonalds, otherwise clean, friendly employees, fresh food"
20787,37,4 years ago,3 stars,"I was here a couple times during a week. I would say it has been pleasant (service as expected). But man, Saturday was not normal. Trash bins over flowing, tables dirty, self help machines missing table locator, and drink dispenser area was messy. From what I could see, the back looked cleaned but the front of the house was a wreck.

Back to the self help machines, it states that they will bring you the drink to your table. They brought me the food but told me to get the cup up front. I don't really care but someone should change what the machine states.

Overall, this is a modern looking McDonald's. Most of the days I went here it has been good. But I guess their weekend was a different story."
20788,37,3 years ago,1 star,The cashier/servers look miserable and when you smile they just straight up look at you like youre vermin to them. They lack personality and they rudely say stuff. Even forgot 2 items out of my order. Went up and got the wrong reciept printed and recieved attitude from the cashier who printed out my reciept.
20789,37,6 years ago,5 stars,"I love that you could touch screen order,  it was easy, and there are people constantly cleaning! I love that they bring the food to the table as well! Very nice, wish I had one where I love! I think more people would enjoy dining in at McDonald's now!"
20790,37,a year ago,3 stars,Well just because that McDonald's is on international drive which is in the tourist area doesn't give him the right to jack up their prices and I go up and down international drive quite a bit I drive charter buses and because their prices are jacked up so high I won't bring a busload of people there now the young lady that brought my lunch out you know she was very very friendly very nice young lady the restaurant is clean but your prices are way too high and until they come down I will not bring 50 60 people in my bus to that location just because you're on international drive don't mean you can rip people off and that's all you're doing when I can take them four miles down the road to a Burger King and their prices are a lot lot lower so if you want to start seeing more charter buses come in there with people lower your prices
20791,37,3 years ago,2 stars,"There's only 1 way to describe my experience. Have you ever gone in to a daycare, and shook a basket full of babies, well I haven't but I could imagine what it sounds like, and that's how it sounded when I walked in the doors, I didn't order anything, and the employees were on there phones anyways. So ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"

20794,37,2 years ago,1 star,I guess they got to rip off their guests to afford the building the management staff are rude when you order a shake medium it comes in a little small kids cup I order two Filet-O-Fish fish or they're not offering the 2 for 5  but that's okay they're not even putting tartar sauce on the sandwich I was just bread  the Fish so I guess they had to cut  cost somewhere when they charge you $15 for fish and don't put anything  on it. I won't go back. Here is how to save some money fire some of those managers that are rude for your guests and that'll save you some money and start building the sandwich correctly
20795,37,4 years ago,1 star,"Went inside to order because wife was dealing with kids.  No line ordered at kiosk right away.  15 workers and no one working.  Manager walking around say hello to customers and no one working. 17 minutes to get 4 egg McMuffins at 8 am
Worst service ever"
20796,37,3 years ago,3 stars,If I was rating this on speed of service it would be negative stars but the food was good once we got it. This location is extremely busy and feels under staffed for the amount of business they get. What is the point of all the kiosks and a double lane drive through if it overwhelms the staff and you wait for 30-40 minutes for a 10pc mcnugget meal?
20797,37,4 years ago,1 star,"Another experience.

I was asked to wait at drive thru. No other customers were in queue. They forgot about me. The order was reduced without telling me. The apple pies were removed without any explanation. When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn't identify herself. She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn't provide it. Bad experience with the food too. The fries were so over salted I couldn't eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen. End to end bad experience.

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff. I waited at the drive thru order kiosk, then at the payment window and then at the pick up window. Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me. I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too. When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order. I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait. Her response was I just put on the headset. Seriously that was her response. There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service. Why didn't she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person. I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness. NOT LOVING IT.

Visited again on 3/17/2018 and had the same experience. Even the white shirt manager ignored me."
20798,37,a year ago,4 stars,No heavy traffic which means your food is made fresh and rarely sitting for too long. Would recommend over McDonald's entertainment location further up international drive where the prices are significantly higher.
20799,37,4 years ago,2 stars,"The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about 5 minutes before they could even take an order.  I'm a local and I wouldn't ever go back to this location again. Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area.  Also, clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English. This is difficult if you're trying to ask anything of the clerk.  Would not recommend."

20801,37,11 months ago,1 star,"24 hours if you drive maybe advertises as lobby open 5am-3am however is closed to the public more often than its open, with no explanation of why the doors are locked but drive through is open and employees will just watch you through the window, terrible service"
20802,37,4 years ago,4 stars,"Only used thr drive through, but order was correct and the food was good.  Busy unit given its location, but the flow through the two lanes was pretty swift.

Interactions with staff were efficient and pleasant."
20803,37,3 years ago,2 stars,"Sorely disappointed. Outlets in every wall and not a single one working. The girl at counter looked at me like I was dumb the entire time I tried to order and seemed like she didnt have a clue how to answer any question I asked. The guy sweeping the lobby was very cordial and actually tried to warn me none of the outlets worked, so kudos to him. Place was clean enough I guess."

He has been mixing and preparing sodas wrong for days"
20805,37,4 years ago,1 star,"This location is incredible. It has two stories. Has automated machines to order from. You can get a variety of different items to try out that aren't at regular McDonald's. It's always super busy here too so expect a wait.

I'm a local and I decided to try something different when a friend was visiting so we came here and ordered pizza. I was so sick for the next three days that I couldn't leave bed. Never again."
20806,37,9 months ago,1 star,Paid for nuggets by time I walked all the way to my apartment approximately 25 minutes and we started to eat we opened up the food no nuggets
20807,37,2 years ago,3 stars,"This McDonald's is across the street from the Orange County Convention Center. The girl at the counter looked at us when we got there, and made no attempt to greet us or even approach the counter until we asked her if she was Ok. The food was fine, but the service definitely needs improvement."
20808,37,3 years ago,5 stars,"I never thought I would rate a McDonald's as 5 stars but I did. Food was typical of a McDonald's but the staff were truly incredible for a fast food restaurant. They smiled, checked up on us, cleaned up our tables and looked far more professional than the normal locations."
20809,37,4 years ago,2 stars,"On Saturday, at 11:25am, drive through is moving at 4 to 5 minutes per car, which works out to about 30 to 35 minutes to get your food from when order was placed. Also, only use lane 1 and you will go faster."
20810,37,2 years ago,1 star,"The worst McDonald's in the area. I have lived close to this McDonald's for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good experience. My order is either not accurate or the food is unacceptable. Also the team members and management just don't seem  to care. I'm not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant, however this last visit has really ticked me off, I couldn't even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent, and then she wanted to act like she couldn't hear me. Other times I have visited this location,  I have had an issue where items were left off my order, so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items, it would all be cold. I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave ... I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly 3 items. With that said I will not be back to this McDonald's location ever."
20811,37,2 years ago,3 stars,"Great food. Not speaking English at the drive-through window is a big downfall for me.  Not sure why they would put somebody like that taking orders. I repeated myself three different times and then they finally brought somebody else to the window. Very frustrating
RJ."
20812,37,3 years ago,3 stars,"The management staff were bullying a new employee by telling her have needed to clean the dirty trays , the manger did this while the girl was taking my order, very uncool. The rest of the staff in the drive through laughed at the the poor girl and I was embarrassed for her. I mean I know it's just a starting job for some people, but they still need to be professional."
20813,37,5 years ago,5 stars,This place was freaking unbelievable!  It has a elevator that takes you up to the game room where all the fun begins.  The food was good.

20814,37,3 years ago,4 stars,The friendliest mcdonalds staff I have ever met! Tasha was the sweetest worker there! The food was good and as isially good price. They had some fancy new machines that had to be 2019 machines I was lost and couldn't get a refill cause it made me anxious and they were busy! But overall good time okay food good people

20816,37,a year ago,1 star,Severely understaffed for such a busy location. I've seen McDonald's with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere. Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something.
20817,37,a year ago,1 star,"Took more than 30 minutes in drive thru with 5 cars ahead of me. Not only the slowest McDonalds ever, but by far the slowest McDonalds I have ever been to."
20818,37,3 years ago,1 star,"Ordered 2 cheeseburgers with no pickles. I got 2 burgers with no cheese and pickles. The establishment itself was clean kept and had a nice interior update to it. The soda machine is a touch screen and you can add flavor shots to it if you'd like. So, if you like Russian Roulette, this might be the McDonalds for you."
20819,37,10 months ago,5 stars,Really nice place. Best McDonalds I've ever seen. Milkshake was good too.
20820,37,a year ago,2 stars,"We were not impressed with this location. They locked the doors at lunch and only ran the drive-through. We made it inside, but that wasn't much better. The workers were not friendly and I had to order at a kiosk."
20821,37,2 years ago,1 star,McDonalds International Drive had really terrible customer service. Not sure what's hard about ice cream in a cup but they were determined to charge us for a sundae and could not have been less cooperative. Chick-fil-A this is why I love you so much.
20822,37,a year ago,1 star,If you prefer to talk to a person then DO NOT go to this location. They only take orders made by kiosk in the dinning room.
20823,37,2 years ago,1 star,"Worlds worst McDonald's. Went there on may 7th 2021 at approximately 11pm pizza was closed ,play are arcade closed,  ordered food to eat in tables dirty, asked several times to get it cleaned, and to get better in had to stand on a line for 35 minutes to get my drink because they wouldn't bring it to the table what a joke Spanish manager was a witch to be nice I say nasty nasty and a joke to run it like this she had no care"
20824,37,2 years ago,1 star,"This is the worst run McDonald's I have EVER seen in my life, the service is super slow. Its complete chaos. The manager should be immediately terminated along with the rest of the useless staff. I would rate it zero but that wasn't an option."
20825,37,4 years ago,1 star,"If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight. The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty. McDonald's, I'd fix this ladies attitude or I'd find her replacement."
20826,37,a year ago,4 stars,Totally not the staff's fault but there was only 1 person to take orders from the double drive thru. There were also a few minor mistakes on our order but considering they barely had staff I expected it.
20827,37,2 years ago,1 star,I have no idea how the employees got hired. They are so rude and have no manners. They literally see you standing there for over 10 minutes waiting and no one offers to help.They all need to stay home if they donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
20828,37,a year ago,2 stars,All that technology and they can't remember how to put two sandwiches in a bag. Maybe if they had a few more people instead of LCD screens?
20829,37,3 years ago,1 star,Drive thru 10 minutes to get to screen to order. Then no one to take order for another 5 minutes. Can't get out of line. Trapped!  Such slow service. Sort of silly for this newly updated McDonald's to be poorly run or staffed.
20830,37,4 years ago,1 star,26min in queue is when the manager tells me i have to make my order in one of the machines because she doesn't have someone who can take my order. Really sad i waist my time and did not get my strawberry shake. International Driveway to busy for this time of the day. They need more personal.
20831,37,5 years ago,1 star,"I wish there were warning signs on the drive in. Turn back now- unless you have 30 minutes to wait in the drive thru to order, pay and receive your food. Once you pull in and someone comes up behind you, you are stuck..... Hopefully you don't want any Coke with your meal. And forget any all day breakfast items that will add an additional 20 minutes on to your wait. Haven't even tasted my food yet. Do not recommend."

20834,37,4 years ago,3 stars,We used the kiosks to order and pay for the food. You are supposed to take a number and sit down and they will bring you your food. We had to wait for numbers. She told me they've had those kiosks for at least 8 months. The staff was overwhelmed with the amount of orders. We had to get the food ourselves from the counter. My poor mom had to wait in the line because she couldn't make the kiosk work. She was so stressed out by the time she sat down.
20835,37,4 months ago,1 star,Service and costumer service awful horrible!!
20836,37,5 years ago,2 stars,"I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries. I even heard them making comments about the free coupon. Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times. I stopped by 4 times in one week and had an issue each time.

The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the 2 stars instead of 1"
20837,37,5 years ago,1 star,"Took forever, which I've gotten used too, being a very popular location close to the tourist traps of international drive. But the service and order quality has been way less that satisfactory more times than I could count. And not to forget, neither of my kids of my kids even got the ""Pokemon toy"" or any toy for that matter that they asked for."
20838,37,a year ago,1 star,"Absolute worse McDonalds I've ever been to.  Restrooms were a mess, ordered food, gave up after 30 minutes and gave receipt to some other folks waiting for their order."
20839,37,a year ago,3 stars,Wait was not too long at all. Line moved evenly. Although order was incorrect and corrected. It took a long time to get 1 drink
20840,37,4 years ago,2 stars,Soda machine on drive thru window was broken on 12/01/2018 at  around 10:30pm. The person who was taking the order was kind enough to give me the option to go inside with the cup and use the machine inside but his manager told him he could not offer me that option therefore I was unable to buy a soda. Great Management Skills.

20843,37,4 years ago,1 star,"Was awful at this location!!!! FILTHY!!! Had staff just moving trays of trash around from table to table.. The self pay was out of order, took 15 minutes for someone to notice we were at the registers to pay, with only 2 other customers in the restraunt.

Her name is GERLINE, and she's a nasty, unprofessional piece of work who needs to learn how to be courteous when speaking to customers, and not be rude and treat them like they are an inconvenience. Nasty little piece of work she is. Other than that, all good."

20856,37,3 years ago,1 star,Arrived starving from water park.30 minutes after ordering large order of food( no deals on that was on other branches) still no food so asked staff who said would look into it. 45 minutes later one staff arrived with sandwich only out of 4 meals and desserts saying rest coming. 1 hour later rest of order arrived no desserts and on checking burger brought was wrong. Went down to complain so called manager shrugged shoulders said other stuff sent up and was attitude of so what that was terrible service. Half machine for kids to play upstairs broke and ridiculous amount of tickets to get smallest prize. Will never be back. If u want mcdonalds go to smaller local branch as will have deals and hopefully better service.
20857,37,4 years ago,1 star,"I couldn't tell you much about the food or service because it wasn't open. Supposedly 24 hour location but closed for maintenance.

I'm already waiting 40 minutes on Curbside Pickup and nothing. It already happened sometimes, I will not come back to this Mc Donald's anymore. Terrible customer service."
20862,37,4 years ago,1 star,Sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes before being able to order. Part of the delay was due to another car deciding thier time was more valuable by cutting the line so it pushed three other cars besides mine back in line. Two other cars followed suit so we couldn't even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in. When I called to complain while forced to stay in line I was on hold for 6 minutes before hanging up because the manager didnt want to answer my call
20863,37,7 years ago,1 star,"Unbelievably poor service. Ordered 3 items. 2 bagged immediately but then waited 15 mins for final item - a double cheeseburger. By this time first 2 items cold so asked for a fresh re order.  30 mins later! Walked out with barely an apology. Given the numerous bad reviews for this outlet you would expect a change in personnel. Avoid if you can, don't expect if you cannot."
20864,37,4 years ago,1 star,"Normally visit this location 4 out of 7 days a week usually early mornings and staff dont seem to want to be there which is ok because it is early 530am. On 4/21/19 the frappe machine is down for cleaning at 5am, and now on 4/22/19 the system is completely down. It's becoming a place that isn't dependable."
20865,37,5 years ago,2 stars,Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about 20 mins start to finish. For being a fast food they are super slow. They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job. My French fries were cold. One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong. I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people.

While the others are slowly deteriorating, this one maintains its beauty!! Everybody is always working hard and the inside is so clean. If it takes long that just means theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
20867,37,3 years ago,1 star,What a horrible experience. I sat at the front counter for over 15 mins for utensils and sauce on Dec 21st at 9:45pm. The so called manager and the employees never once acknowledged me nor other customers that walked up for assistance with their orders that THEY messed up. Honestly the manager should be fired or retrained she had no customer service skills or manager skills at that. This mcdonalds makes the rest look bad.
20868,37,4 years ago,1 star,"Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies. We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens. He asked his manager to check. She straight out refused. We couldn't even complete one of our orders.

30 minutes after placing our other order, we received fries so cold, when I went up to the front to get fresh ones, I didn't even have to say anything. One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence.

The bathrooms were nasty, the tables were dirty, every trash can was over flowing, and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish. This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando."
20869,37,3 years ago,2 stars,The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice. When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it. I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok. She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I don't know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold. I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed. Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully.  Usually go to this location at least 4 times but will NEVER return and encourage any one I know to skip this location
20870,37,3 years ago,1 star,What a waste of time we were there in line for more than 30 minutes. The woman at the window asked for our receipt and still did not get the order correct. We spent 5 minutes at pick up trying to get it corrected . When I asked for my re eipt back she told me she lost it. When I said I wanted the Manager she slammed the window shut. The manager  said she put the order together from the receipt. He stated the order screen only holds orders for 25 minutes. Not sure what to think McDonalds at this location in the later evening I would suggest do not stop find another.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
20871,37,5 years ago,1 star,"Horrible service- stood there for 20 minutes trying to pay 6.00 for my food. Manager was talking to one customer ignoring others, workers were in back play fighting. Drive through line was around the building and over 12 customers in line. After 20 minutes, asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by  register- she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away. She was very ride to customer in front of me also who had waited longer for his food. Will never go back there and advise others to avoid this mcdonalds."
20872,37,3 years ago,1 star,We shouldn't  even be waiting for fast food more than 40 minutes . For order of chicken nuggets. Please . Also they wanted to give us watered down drinks . I mean i know fast food   isn't easy but damn 40 minutes really give me a break. Staff is extreamly slow. Won't  be back.

20874,37,3 years ago,1 star,"Waited 40 minutes in the drive thru, and then they started turning cars away. Would've loved to go somewhere else, but the options were sparse at 1 AM. Got up to the window and the manager literally didnt even care about the horrible service."
20875,37,2 years ago,1 star,Horrible food.....bag the  chicken sandwich came in had a disgusting almost like a gasoline smell.....and the sandwich was not warm at all....and the sandwich tasted like it had been sitting around for a very good amount of time....I threw it away immediately and spit out the bite I had in my mouth....disgusting... disappointing...and I stopped visiting the McDonald's on hwy 29 Cantonment because of bad food and sloppy service...and this one on pine forest rd Pensacola..will be on my McDonald's never to visit too......

20878,37,3 years ago,5 stars,"This location gets super busy, but the staff seems to take it all.in stride. They are all very nice and polite. I had a good experinece here and would go back, even though they forgot the pickles on my cheeseburger. That makes the McDonalds Cheeseburger."
20879,37,4 years ago,5 stars,"Although McDonald's chain is known for it great customer service and fast delivery, however this outlet is different.
They are usually late in service even they are a very few customers.
Moreover, they have less no of options of eatables including snacks and beverages. Sometimes their machines do not work and customers have to wait to make payment."
20880,37,5 years ago,1 star,"If I could give this less than 1 star I absolutely would! I spent 30 minutes in line just to get 2 meals and 2 ice creams for my kids. Waited 15 minutes just to pay and another 15+ to get our food. Will NEVER recommend this location to anyone. The sad part, I didn't have high expectations because it was late on a Saturday night and all of the theme parks were letting out and even my low expectations were shattered."
20881,37,3 years ago,1 star,"Warning avoid this location at all costs.Truly one of the worst McDonald's in the nation. There's always an issue in the drive-through there's always an issue when you go inside the store. The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3' ruled is. Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would. When you go through the drive-through there is not a proper greeting. It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order. There is no quality service. It's all about quantity, instead of quality."
20882,37,6 years ago,1 star,"Employees I dealt with were rude. When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right. We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong. The girl went to the back and came back with the right order, didn't say anything or make eye contact, just handed me the bag. This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment, fast food or not. I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonald's than deal with what I had to deal with."
20883,37,5 years ago,1 star,"Absolutely one of the worst experiences ever at McDonald's. Ordered a ice coffee and cappuccino at 10:13 pm..waited and waited..drive through backed up, 20-30 people inside waiting, absolute chaos. Finally at 10:47pm the lady asked what I ordered and made them so I could leave. Literally 35 minutes for coffee. Horrible experience, short staffed and totally out of control."
20884,37,4 years ago,1 star,"I usually frequent McDonald's at least once a week, whether its to grab a coffee or get some pancakes for my little one. This visit was probably the worst I've experienced. I ordered my food at 9:11AM - A mcgriddle, a coffee, and two hashbrowns. Once I paid I was immediately told to go to #1, so I did. After waiting until 9:30AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other. After handing me my bag, I asked about my drink and she said ""What drink"", I said the coffee that's listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt. She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me. I waited an additional 2 minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me, a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee. Needless to say, my patience went thin and I told her to forget about it and I had to leave. I paid for something I never received and was treated with the most disrespect in my book. Coming from a long time McDonalds customer, I wont be back again."

20889,37,5 years ago,1 star,"There was one car in front of me when I pulled up at 5am. More than 20 minutes for a single egg mcmuffin. I was given no explanation or apology for the wait either. I'm honestly appalled at the poor service, especially at such a nice location. I will literally never come here ever again."
20890,37,4 years ago,2 stars,"Don't know why, but ever since the rebuild of this site, the burgers are unbearable. Never juicy, dry and unfavorable as can be... From the little burgers to the quarter pounder, it's the same. Doesn't even taste like meat anymore. They had the same problem with the nuggets at first but that got better after a few months, but we'll over a year now, and the burgers are just like eating flavored cardboard. What happened?"
20891,37,4 years ago,5 stars,I love this McDonald's.  It's across from Hilton Orlando.  They got good deals for breakfast and during the day.  The quality is amazing.... Way beyond what I expected.  The McCafe drinks were so good...not water down like those in NYC.  I am giving this place 5 stars if you want cheap meals that fill you up!!!

She told me we ran out of eggs and just left me there at the window without telling me they were making more. Then she came back s few minutes later and handed me my food(Big Breakfast which is supposed to come with OJ) and I asked for salt and pepper and she said it was already in the bag, which it is NOT, and then shut the window in my face. The meat wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t fully cooked and the eggs still runnie. I walked in to find out she is the actual manager.

20895,37,3 years ago,1 star,"Just went through the drive thru, young lady at payment window needs additional training on what is considered proper customer care.  She was having a full on conversation with a coworker related to a personal matter (candy she had sitting on the counter next to her), the other coworker indicated she had a customer to which she stated "" I dont care"".  She continued her conversation leaving me sitting there until she finished. Never said hello or thank you.
Once I received my food it was in a bag dripping with grease.
I should have driven a quarter mile up the road to Wendys.
Shameful"

Recieved 2 egg mcmuffins that must of been sitting since the morning hours from breakfast. The white portion of the egg was almost black. They are supposed to make them fresh after breakfast hours not serve on from 12 hours prior.

20900,37,5 years ago,1 star,HORRIBLE! It took 54 mins to get our food and then it was nasty. We watched the manager mix sweet and unsweet to fill a mans tea. Noone ever asked for our order so we pulled forward at the window. Will NEVER stop at this location on our way home from Seaworld. EVER!

So I ordered a meal as well because it was well maintained inside-out. Looking for a good restaurant?! This location knows hospitality. Lol"
20907,37,4 years ago,3 stars,"Dirtiest McDonald's we've ever been in, but the food was fine.  Delayed flight so this was the only thing open at 3 a.m. The lobby was open and someone was in the process of cleaning it, she was friendly too. You can only order at a kiosk, which was new to us."
20908,37,3 years ago,1 star,"The ONLY reason I gave this place one star is because I couldn't give it ZERO!
we ordered on a kiosk at McDonald's because the counter line was too long.  Come to find out it's because the kiosks weren't taking payment?  I then proceeded to wait in line FOR AN HOUR to just PAY for my food.  When I asked for a refund for my friend's food the manager pointed at food that had been sitting there no less than 10 mins and said ""it's coming.""  Uh, no!  Needless to say we got our refund and ended up going across the street to iHOP instead.  Shout out to the waiter at iHOP and the whole staff for doing so much better than McDonald's!"

20911,37,4 years ago,1 star,One of my worst experiences at a McDonalds ever.   I waited in a line at the drive through for 20  minutes.  Get to the first window where I hand them my card and end up paying for someone else's order.   Waited longer to correct that situation.  The order at the window was wrong.  Waited some more for that to be corrected.  Finally the lid to my soda wasn't on so when I went to grab it in the car the lid popped off the cup and spilled all over me.
20912,37,4 years ago,1 star,"It took 26 minutes for them to make 5 double cheeseburgers. I asked the manager Daniel why, he said they just completed a large online order. I told him this was the 2nd time in a month I had to wait an outrageous time for fast food and he just starred at me blankly. Eventually Daniel told me I was holding him up and making other people wait. I thought that was pretty rude and unconstructive for a manager to say. Terrible location, regardless of how busy it is, it almost always looks like a warzone inside with trash everywhere and nasty, dirty tables, and the wait time for food can be really ridiculous and on top of all that the staff is rude."

20941,37,4 years ago,1 star,We are British but never had the same problem on our many visits to Florida. He persons taking our order just didn't understand what we were asking for. Very frustrating seeing as our language is almost identical
20942,37,5 years ago,5 stars,"The best McDonald's I've ever been to, hands down. My kids could play in the play area for hours. The made to order omelette, served to me at my table on a China plate, was delicious. The staff are overly gracious and professional. If you have been to Orlando and not stopped here you are missing out!"
20943,37,4 years ago,1 star,We ordered on the online tablet and we sat down and waited for 15 minutes and got tired of waiting so we went to the front and was told that our food was given to us ten minutes ago and it wasn't clearly. They remade the order and of course it was incorrect so I had to go and get them to fix it again.
20944,37,2 years ago,1 star,No inside seating. Rude employees that barely noticed I was there. No napkins in my bag and no one asked or seemed to care if I needed any. I had to remind them my meal came with a drink.
20945,37,3 years ago,4 stars,It was a little pricey. Just like eating in a real restaurant. $50 for a family of 4. But I'm sure it cheaper if you get normal meau things. We got noodles and pizza. It was plenty of food for the price.
20946,37,3 years ago,5 stars,"The single NICEST McDonald's I've ever been to!!  And that includes the location on the Disney property complex.  2 floors, massive play area for kids, full arcade, elevator, and the bring the food to you.  Glad to see the owners transform this place.  Well done!!"
20947,37,5 years ago,1 star,"Very poor. 22 minutes of waiting on my order to be wrong and it was sitting on the back counter the whole time. Didn't say anything because I knew I hadn't ordered what was on the tray. Employees only wanted to do one thing and passing the buck to someone else. The kiosks don't work properly. The line to get your money is quick enough but the wait is ridiculous. Only 6 words of English amongst the whole crew. ""Thand you"" ""I sorry"" ""Come again"". Wel here are 2 more for you, Never Again!"
20948,37,a year ago,5 stars,"Never ever had service like this in a maccies! Don't know if it was had a convention on next door, but was outstanding!"
20949,37,6 years ago,4 stars,Probably the nicest McDonald's I've been too. Staff was super nice and really trying their best to make happy customer's and smiles. We even got to try free blueberry pies! (The pies were AWESOME!!)
20950,37,3 years ago,2 stars,"Often very slow bc of the flood of people. Thirty minute wait for fast food is crazy. If you use the mobile app, stick to drive thru. I waited 30 minutes for curbside pick up and 25 minutes in lobby. I recommend getting back in your car and going to Chick-fil-A. Youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll be there and back with your food before anything hap"

20952,37,4 years ago,1 star,"This has to be the WORST experience ever at a fast food place. We used the kiosk and were thrilled because we placed the order faster than the workers that were ignoring us at the counter. THEN they only brought 1/4 of our order. Forgot our 4 McCafe drinks and condiments. Then when one of the teenagers told someone at the counter, he was told to ask someone else. Really? You want $15/hr for this? I had low expectations because no McDonalds gets the order right but damn."
20953,37,3 years ago,5 stars,"So I never thought I would be reviewing a McDonald's,  because well its McDonalds.  However, I was in town for a conference and grabbed a quick lunch in between sessions.  The food was typical McDs, but every staff member was just so friendly and helpful.  Granted I dont eat at inside McDs often, but I have never been so delighted and cared for ar one.  Greeted as I walked in, ordered from kiosks, food delivered to me, staff member checked on how my food was and wished well by members as I left.  McDs needs to bottle up the service from this location and send to all.  Cheers."
20954,37,a year ago,1 star,"Make me wait over 25 min and still get my order wrong, if you want to get upset go to this drive through!"
20955,37,4 years ago,2 stars,Super slow to get food.  It appears drive thru got all the attention.  15 minutes to get food is too long.  Also when I order a breakfast meal with a soda I want the choice to get a larger drink when they are all the same price
20956,37,5 years ago,2 stars,I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review seriously. I visited this restaurant last night. It was very clean including the bathroom. At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order. The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register. This wasn't possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk; they had to get a receipt and pay at the register. I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendy's when the line had barely moved.
20957,37,11 months ago,1 star,Terrible. Sign says 24hrs. Door says till 3am. Was denied service at 10:30pm. Attitude was horrible.

20963,37,4 years ago,1 star,"We had to wait about an hour to get our food that we already paid at one of those""self order screens"", it was supposed to be faster but it was a waste of time. Fast food? What a shame guys, you can do better!"
20964,37,4 years ago,2 stars,"New system of ordering at kiosks is aweful. Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being, ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a human...and I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk, very frustrating. Also, the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful, I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink. Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what wasn't broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly dislike?"
20965,37,5 years ago,1 star,"Sorry, coffee was horrible, 3 of us threw it away. Pancakes were rock hard. I cannot find the 1 I visited the other day. They had the McMuffin 2 for $3.50. Excellent service and food was good"

20976,37,3 years ago,4 stars,"New kiosk-based ordering can be a little daunting at first.  But, it does seem to speed things up.  The food is what you've come to expect from McDonald's.  It didn't disappoint."
20977,37,5 years ago,1 star,"Terrible service, I order a few things and had to wait over 20 minutes in order to receive my items. No one approached me and another guy when we were standing at the cashier for over 10 minutes. Not even the managers. I had to ask one of the employees if they actually had a cashier."

20979,37,3 years ago,1 star,"Worst McDonald's experience  ever.  Silent 25 mins in drive thru.  When ordering we were advised could not sub drink in meal with McFlurry and had to purchase separately.  When finally making to window to pay, they couldn't 'find' my order.  For this to be in a Prime location in Orlando,  they completely failed the meaning of fast food."
20980,37,4 years ago,1 star,"Never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant which is a big deal for me to say since my 3 year old is allergic to many things.  This morning around 12:28 am 11/24/18 when asked the very standard "" may I see the food allergy menu"" or since that wasn't available, ""would you mind checking the ingredients on the package while I wait to place my order while others go ahead"" the cashier was told by the manager right in front of me that she would not get the menu nor would she check the ingredients and went right back to laughing and carrying on with another employee.  The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers.  The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables, floors, and bathrooms.  Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite.  Black Friday or not... absolutely unacceptable brazen behavior from management that I would never tolerate under any circumstance from my own team at any level of the company.  Zero stars...would not recommend."
20981,37,6 years ago,1 star,Stopped in to get breakfast and there was mold on my bagel and the oil must haven't been changed in a while because the hash browns tasted like old oil instead of hash browns. Never will stop there again.

Unfortunately, it was NOT a great experience and cleaning McDonald's. Better to give up on McDonald's for once and for ALL. You can base a restaurant by their bathrooms."

20985,37,4 years ago,1 star,I ordered 20pc. Nuggets received 10pc. Nuggets(BAD IN ORDERS). I ordered pasta and what I got was more sauce than actual pasta. I had to ask for my cups because they they give it to me. I recommend to not come here if you dont want to stress out. BAD SERVICE.

20989,37,5 years ago,1 star,"This place deserves no stars. My order, which was just a sandwich, was messed up three times and it still wasn't right. The staff was lazy and unhelpful. There was trash on the tables and filthy floors. Definitely no smiles served at this establishment!"
20990,37,3 years ago,4 stars,Had to order on the tablet screen. Then I was told to take a number to my table and it would be brought out. They never brought it out and I had to go ask for it at the counter 10 minutes later.
20991,37,4 years ago,3 stars,"This McDonalds location is significantly updated on the interior featuring subway tile walls and designed seating.  Also has several self-order kiosks. However, one staff member was very adamant about everyone, both young and old, using the self order kiosk which easily took longer and was less efficient than than ordering at the counter.

One plus to this location is the plentiful parking lot behind the building"
20992,37,2 years ago,1 star,Picked the wrong lane and did not get asked for my order as 3 cars passes by in the other order lane. I pulled up and the manager told me I had to pay inside. It took 30 minutes to order and get my food. Horrible.

A pager or digital board instead of someone telling out names."
21003,37,4 years ago,1 star,"Slow service. They even work with one hand . If we didn't asked for our food after waiting 40 mins , it was just going to be sitting in the kitchen. The place was packed and the service was slow."

21005,37,5 years ago,3 stars,"Stopped in here on January 24th 2018 and ordered at the counter, a signature classic grilled signature sriacha chicken sandwich with an artisan bun. Paid for my order and waited. When my order was ready it was handed to me in a bag.I asked for ketchup and proceeded to a table to enjoy my meal. First off tge fries were crispy which I prefer, but they were old and not at all indicative of the worlds best fries. I took out my sandwich took bite and noticed sesame seeds in the box. I Checked my receipt to confirm that my sandwich should gave had the artisan bun, proceeded to the counter  to correct the problem with my order to be told tgey were out of artisan buns. I was pissed and walked off. I finished my meal, went to refill my drink and spoke with a man in yellow shirt and tie behind the counter about how terrible that the one woman knew there were no artisan buns but the order taker at the register knew nothing about it as well as the girl who gave me my food. Someone should have confirmed that the sesame seed bun would meet my approval. And I notified him this kind of service was not indicative pf McDonald's and that I would be callong corporate. The following day I contacted McDonald's corporate who passed on my complaint to the restaurant location. I received a call from Rose who apologized for the problem with the order and asked that I come back and give them the opportunity to make tge meal properly per my request. I stopped in on Friday January 26th and Emma made sure that the meal was prepared to the standards I believe McDonald's is known. The sandwich was flavorful with the artisan roll and the fries were hot and fresh. Thanks so much for taking the initiative to prepare my meal to the high quality McDonald's is known to deliver."

21025,37,3 years ago,2 stars,Past 2 recent visits my order has been incorrect and required remakes.  They have a lot of employees and all are doing their own thing.  Not an example of fast food.

21027,37,3 years ago,3 stars,I stopped in this McDonald's because it was on my way home. The manager did not want to help me and kept sending me to the kiosk to place my order. Now i was looking to ask a question but she turned around and didn't even want to acknowledge that I was there and kept telling the other workers i had to go to the kiosk.  If there isn't anyone available to help answer a question there should be a phone to pick up and ask for help. She was so rude.

21030,37,6 years ago,1 star,"For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.  Don't bother going here; it's not worth it, unless you want to feel like you're waiting at Disney at a subpar place."

Quite a few people had the same idea as I did to eat late. At least 30 people had ordered and were waiting for food. Very tight space to move around during a busy time. Very unorganized and waited 30 minutes to get my food.

21040,37,4 years ago,1 star,You can not get service at the front counter. They only cater to drive thru and kiosk. Past 2 weeks have stopped and after 10 mins no one would take order after having 3mgr look at you
21041,37,5 years ago,5 stars,Clean place. They have cool machines so you can order yourself but I couldn't figure out how to use it which was surprising to me. It was faster to order at the counter with a cashier.

21043,37,5 years ago,5 stars,"Went in for breakfast on a Monday morning. Went inside, pretty empty. No line for drive thru. It's one of the new touch-screen style McDonald's, service was fast and easy."

21049,37,4 years ago,1 star,"Very over priced, but did bump into my nan so we did have a good catch up about Corrie, but there is a much better place near, BURGER KING. The straws are thicker and the drinks are cooler. I would of gave macdonalds 3 stars but the old women in front of me how took 2 mins and 47 seconds to decide. Yes I counted. Drew the final straw."
21050,37,4 years ago,1 star,"Used the drive thru. Ordered three large fries. Paid for three large fries. Received only two large fries, and no receipt was given to me, so I couldn't go in and prove that I ordered three."

21070,37,5 years ago,1 star,"Staff were swearing on the tills, wandering around in non uniform and using their phones. The girl on the till in the ferrari jumper was flat out ignoring me as I tried to order as she was busy sending Whatapps to friends and the few people who seem to actually care and work hard are stressed as they work with slackers."
21071,37,a year ago,1 star,Had to constantly repeat myself. The manager had asked me to use the kiosk for a custom order when I didn't want to make a custom order.
21072,37,4 years ago,4 stars,This McDonalds is newly renovated with self ordering kiosk. This McDonalds also brings to food to you table for all dining guest thats someting you normally dont see at anyother McDonalds.

21079,37,6 years ago,2 stars,"Quite literally one of the worst McDonald's ever! Staff is incompetent, unfriendly, and doesn't get the order right or the food is OLD. As the manager of a 1500 room resort, I advise all of my guests to detour this location."

21085,37,3 years ago,5 stars,Love the electronic ordering and the table service. It's nice to see that McDonald's is moving in that direction. I had a much better experience because of these amenities.

21096,37,a year ago,5 stars,I love the place. Plenty of food choices and the place is huge.
21097,37,4 years ago,1 star,Raise all their prices due to the Convention center. Some sandwiches raised by $3. As a company this large they should be able to keep the prices lowered rather than ripping off all the people in the area.
21098,37,3 years ago,5 stars,I love the cashier and the people working there there was this guy named Jose which helped me in the register and also threw my food away so I barely needed to do work and it was a great experience for my family next time we visit Orlando I will visit come again

21111,37,3 years ago,5 stars,"I guess this has an extra added experience of a play area and and arcade to boost. But Micky Ds is always somewhere you know you can go anywhere in the world and find something you like, this one was slightly different as you could get pasta and pizza and all day breakfast option"
21112,37,a year ago,1 star,"A great franchise that has gone terribly wrong. Service was bad, order was wrong, and it's suppose to be fast food, not was in line for 21 minutes"
21113,37,4 years ago,2 stars,Beautiful establishment both inside and out but the soda dispensers weren't working and waiting in line to get drinks and ketchup sucks when other customers are placing orders and facing the same dilemma...
21114,37,5 years ago,4 stars,Food is consistent with McDonalds.  New electronic order and table service and overeager employee makes it feel like they are owned by Chik-filet.  I like the old style service with counter ordering and FAST order filling.
21115,37,4 years ago,1 star,Terrible service!!!! Waited at the drive up speaker for minutes before anyone asked for my order.  Then proceeded to wait in the line for over 10 mins.  If someone has food that is taking longer you should pull them up!!

21121,37,4 years ago,1 star,I am so tired of these franchises ripping off customers and upscaling the prices on items that are supposed to be a dollar! McDonald's just needs to take down this $1 $2 $3 deal. It seems as if every McDonald's I go into now is ran by either Hoodrats or Morons that are unable to perform their job duties.
21122,37,2 years ago,3 stars,"I never go to McDonald's but my fiancï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ was telling me about a Chips Ahoy McFlurry?? I had to try it, and honestly it was soo good...but could do with less"

21144,37,5 years ago,1 star,"Mario - glasses, dark hair. What an irresponsible manager. Left everything to manager Stephanie whilst he disregarded customers. Food missing from orders, another customer (young teenager ) spoken to like dirt by a female member of staff.
I tried to complain about Mario who did not respond appropriately (couldn't be bothered to make any verbal response) but had to wait forever for Stephanie as she was putting out fires all over the restaurant. You could not pay me to work with Mario or the newly appointed manager who was called to speak with me  but never came over despite eye contact and him making a grumpy sound(young, black guy who was more into showing off in front of the young female staff than treating any woman with respect).
What ever the main manager, Stephanie is being paid isn't enough. I saw her run, rule, command the show in a way that got the job done. She was gracious with all customers whilst her staff were ignorant gits."

21156,37,5 years ago,1 star,"Epic McDonald's on International dr. Is lacking customer service.  Had the coupon for free Happy Meal from Visit Florida.  They didn't want to give it to us because we downloaded from site and printed not from tourist booklet.  Then said it was not actually for a happy meal.  Just drink, fries, and burger/nuggets. "" No box, toy, yoghurt or toy""  even though the coupon stated ""HAPPY MEAL""  no small print.  Girl at drive thru wasn't nice.  Prices at epic McDonald's are quite a bit higher than the other locations and no $1,2,3 menu"
21157,37,4 years ago,2 stars,In almost all McDonald's I have been going have self order post. The bad news is when the machine freezes up you have to go at front and ask for help right? No help you need to l look ace the order again.

21185,37,4 years ago,3 stars,The workers were unfriendly and ignored our needs:  two cups for pop and ketchup with our fries. Seating is mostly hard and not comfortable.  We might not return to the McDonald's!!

21187,37,5 years ago,1 star,Great place to go and have you're entire order screwed up. Then have them tell you there's no milkshakes after you pay for one meanwhile they give the lady beside you one

21194,37,5 years ago,5 stars,"Im pretty sure that this is still the largest McDonald's in the world. Three stories and a menu that rivals many other restaurants. Large selection of desrts and other foods as well. Its more like a "" theme"" restaurant. Pizza and pasta plus so much more with a McDonald's theme and of course the normal Mickey D's menu is included."

15mins to make a qtr pounder no cheese meal."
21196,37,3 years ago,5 stars,Very clean MacDonalds. Great grew. However MacDonalds needs to make french fries like they use to. They've lost their loving feeling on quality.

21221,37,5 days ago,1 star,Inside counter served all takeout orders before any dine in customers. Watching customers that ordered over 10mins after myself get theirs first. After getting the food the fries and Big Mac were both ever under cooked. This place shouldn't even be open

Also it is very clean, during my waiting time of 4 hours they cleaned the tables several times.

I fully recommend to visit this place."
21227,37,8 months ago,1 star,"Hawaiian Court location -
Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the ""Fast Food"" label.
From order to recieving the food, it took 42mins, and even then the order came out wrong.
There was one manager, one fry cook and one burger cook, trying to complete a dinner time rush, yet there were 3 cleaning staff going round cleaning 1 table every 20mins or so.
This team could really do with some logistical training on how to get orders out efficiently and on time, because this really was a poor attempt at ""fast food""."
21228,37,5 days ago,3 stars,They have several self check out kiosks
21229,37,4 days ago,5 stars,We only went through the drive through.
21230,37,2 days ago,5 stars,"Good service, tucked away"
21231,37,7 years ago,1 star,"Employees I dealt with were rude. When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right. We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong. The girl went to the back and came back with the right order, didn't say anything or make eye contact, just handed me the bag. This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment, fast food or not. I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonald's than deal with what I had to deal with."

21236,37,4 years ago,5 stars,The food is great and they have excellent service for a cheap price.I personally think that their french fries and burgers taste better than Outbacks and its even cheaper than Outback.

21271,37,4 years ago,2 stars,Adopting the kiosks eliminated any chance for interaction with a person. The lack of counter and lobby staff makes for a customers helping customers.

Though the contents of my order were accurate, my burger tasted weird and when I looked I observed it to be actually raw.  The photo below is unfiltered and unretouched.  It's upside down because I tossed it that way in my plate.   It was terrifying.   I called immediately,  and was requested to come back with my receipt which the manager did refund JUST the burger part of my order.   I really can't get over it.  Just a word of warning before you go to this particular location.  It was disgusting and disastrous!"
21627,32,4 years ago,2 stars,"About half of my visits are pretty terrible but it's a drive thru option that's on my way to work.  Today my ""bacon egg and cheese bagel"" had no bacon.  $8.99 for a missing ingredient is absolutely ridiculous."

No sense of Urgency. They need to be more like Chick Filet. I heard several ordered after mine weren't  right. Disappointed."
21639,32,a year ago,1 star,"I ordered and CLEARLY STATED that I wanted two sandwiches, four hash browns and two ice coffees. They only put me for one coffee. I told them I ordered two so they charge me for the other coffee.
I ask for my ""extra"" coffee they were confused and said that they ordered me an extra sandwich so they had to fix that and refund me and gave me my 2nd coffee. I finally thought It was fixed, so when I left and got to my destination, I realize this INUTILE a cashier only ordered me one hash brown instead of four. Moral of the story, McDonalds, either train your cashiers right or buy new equipment because a simple order shouldn't have taken me more that 10 minutes of my day.

This McDonalds is the ONLY truly well-managed McD's in NoVa in my opinion (and I've tried 'em all!), the only one that at least acts like it actually WANTS customers to come inside!  Things they do that other McD's often do not. 1) free coffee refills 2) power for laptops 3) USB ports 4) bowl of McD's breath mints at counter 5) ample parking 6) friendly employees 7) CLEAN 8) updated 9) don't push the awful ordering kiosks (16 screen touches to order a coffee?! - please) 10) very pleasant dining room, lots of windows and sunny, and they clean the windows constantly 11) nice bathrooms w/ hot water 12) comfy padded seating.

We rang the bell, and one of the staffs pointed his hand to show us to the drive thru. We came there to wait about 15 minutes and no one answered us even though no one were in front of us and couples cars behind in line. We let a car behind came before us and she got no response, too. Terrible service."

Not to mention I specifically asked for no onions. Not paying attention to my order on the screen, I drove up only to find the lady trying to hand me 4 large ice teas in addition to my regular order. Confirmed on the receipt that I was charged, I was not willing to wait for further fumbling about for $4. I said don't worry about it, dont want the teas and don't care about the $4.

But over the past few months, it has become so much more to me. I know the pleather seats like the back of my hand, I know the nuances of the quick-order kiosks, I chuckle every time I see that little piece of gum stuck on the side of the drive-thru wall, I know when the fries are being made fresh, I know and love that greasy sheen on the floor.

It has a hi top bar with 8 sits, maybe? each one with a power outlet with USB ports to charge on the fly.
Is well lit, nicely decorated, and the staff is friendly."
21672,32,5 years ago,1 star,"Every single time I have gone through the drive thru at this location, it has taken at least 20 minutes to complete the transaction. They have a sauce they're advertising on a poster at the drive through that says ""Honey"" sauce, but when you get to the window, no one knows what you're talking about.
Anyhow, the most recent experience was a great example of poor customer service and why we won't be returning to this location.
Waiting at the drive thru for almost half an hour like usual, the manager comes to the window where they give you your food and says that our (my husband and I's) nuggets aren't done yet and requests us to park nearby to wait. That's fine, as we do so without complaint. The manager comes out 5-10 minutes later to give us our food. We take it and get home to find that the bottom box in the bag was some nasty ass Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich, and not 20piece nuggets. That's not what we paid for or ordered. We go back to this McDonalds another day and ask for the manager; his employees had to yell for him and almost convince him to come up to the window, as I heard them yelling to him, ""They want to talk to you!"" countless times, as if he asked out of frustration and anger. After he was torn away from the slow work he wasn't helping with while in his office, he pretended he didn't understand what I said and said he couldn't write anything or give me a coupon for anything since he didn't have some kind of coupon book? I asked him if he could give us  what we bought next time since we had already paid. He said yes and we left. Yesterday was the last day we visited this location; and we asked for the manager at the first pay window. He acted like he had no idea who we were after that whole ordeal and gave us HALF off our 20 piece nuggets that we were buying! He lied to our faces after he said he would take care of it! You would think how much revenue, McDonalds brings in, the manager wouldn't be so stingy and would apologize and provide what's necessary to remediate the situation! He acted so snide and unapologetic too. Needless to say, experiencing slow service, disrespect and a poor account of responsibilities; we won't be returning."

This location just opened not that long ago and lack of detail on orders given is already a huge problem. If you want good reviews then pay attention to the people ordering your food.

Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it. Now it's just a boring, modern McDonald's with bleh service. The remodel was a mistake and if you're going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves. Probably won't come back during our zoo trips anymore. ï¿½ï"

Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost 7 minutes.   Had I walked around and noticed the mess, we would have left.

As I'm writing this, I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe.   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner.

I really wanted an Oreo McFlurry and was willing to even settle for some fresh baked or classic McDonald character bag of cookies, but they said that their ice cream machine was down and they were completely out of any and all cookies (sad face). As we pulled away from the drive-thru and continued on our way to our final destination, we realized that they gave us the wrong order. We spent about $20, but only received maybe $5 worth of food. The lobby was closed, the line was long, and we were too tired to turn back. I tried calling this location more than 3 times and even submitted a complaint/help request via the McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake, yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts?"

What a waste of money! It doesn't make sense. It's as if they are deliberately trying to lose money and encourage people to stay away.

21979,29,3 years ago,5 stars,"It's a McDonald's with a Zoo twist. If you are reading this review, you likely already know how the food tastes and what is on the menu. The key difference here is the great animal decorations on the outside. More importantly though is how efficient this location is. Every time I've been through I've seen a drive through 10 cars deep and watched them churn through everyone's orders in a matter of minutes. If only every drive through was this efficient."

21985,29,4 months ago,1 star,Worst thing here at this location is ordering from the app an waiting for your order over 20 minutes now they need to get better service.
21986,29,9 months ago,1 star,"The App let's you order breakfast and pay ahead, but when you show up and it's 10:03, their system won't let them complete your order.

The location is relatively good, the employees are always friend and fast.

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office/app devs and need to either decide to

1) prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 10:00 shut off, or

2) allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after ""it's no longer breakfast time""

I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at 10:03 on the way to work."

21998,29,a year ago,1 star,"So, I got to this location frequently, despite hearing the horror stories about this location, because it is close to me. Well, tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it.
First, I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese, Tea for the drink, make the combo a large. So, the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen. I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink, and he tells me that I ordered it wrong. I said, ""Well, normally when I come here, they default to sweet tea."" I said that because they usually do  He said, ""Nah! That's not how we do it. Then, he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese, sweet tea, and make the combo a large. I saw that it was not right on the screen, but he repeated the order to me correctly.  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me. I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double. The person at the window talked to the person who took my order, and he came to the window and yelled, ""I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED."" I told him that I said ""double"" several times when I ordered, 5 times to be exact. He person who took my order, who looked to be a manager, yelled at me, ""NO! IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT. YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE.""

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea. He finally told me that he would make it order, but I did not trust him at this point, so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back.

This was an awful experience and I will not be back. I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years."

But now it looks like a tourist trap. Some days you'll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot. Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain it's quality that it had. As far as the food goes. Well it's McDonald's same as any other.

22013,29,a year ago,4 stars,Great people fast not mess up your order real pros to. The manager asked if my order was right! He's was great nice polite and friendly.
22014,29,a year ago,1 star,Rudest night crew I've ever experienced. The boy they have acting as a manager is horrible and very unprofessional. All they do is blast rap music and play with each other and be rude to the customers.
22015,29,8 months ago,1 star,"Night employees are stealing from customers, and probably the restaurant as well.
They short changed me twice on the same order, and claimed the receipt machine was ""not working"" when i asked for the receipt."
22016,29,a month ago,4 stars,Food is always fresh and hot.
22017,29,4 years ago,5 stars,"The service was good. The young girl assisting me was polite.
Their playground is huge, and air conditioned. And its decorated nicely. We liked the tables with animals on them!!
My kids have been begging to come in here. They loved it."
22018,29,8 months ago,1 star,"I could not eat the food from the zoo McDonald's so I gave the food to the cats outside...and the cats outside my house did not even take a wiff at it...idk?
Becarefull with the food up there in the Zoo McDonald's?"
22019,29,a year ago,1 star,I used to love McDonald's fries but not no more. You can't never really get anything fresh from McDonald's. I used to tell them could they make my McChicken now when they did it taste so much better. But everything is preheated or been waiting for you LOL
22020,29,a year ago,2 stars,"They where not friendly. The girl at the drive through was on her phone and didnt give us change or receipt. Got to the 2nd window was handed our drinks and asked to pull in a spot. Waited at least 15 mins before anyone came out to our car. Asked what we ordered....and for our receipt ..which we didnt have....
Finally brought our food out and 2 burgers where wrong..."
22021,29,2 years ago,5 stars,Fast food drive through service was quick and courteous. Great! Dine-in was not available yet. I am looking forward to seeing the inside. Fun animal theme would be fun to enjoy with the kids after a day at the zoo.
22022,29,a year ago,1 star,My order was handed to someone else who IMMEDIATELY ATE MY FRIES! MGMT OFFERED TO REMAKE MY ORDER FRESH WHICH I AGREED. THE ORDER CAME OUT LESS THAN 30SECS LATER. I USED TO WORK FOR MC.Ds AND OTHER FF RESTAURANTS AND I KNEW THAT WASN'T RIGHT!! TRASHED THE FOOD.SMDH!!!0
22023,29,4 years ago,5 stars,They actually have a play area which most McDonald's don't anymore.  We also loved the animals inside and outside
22024,29,a year ago,5 stars,"New staff provide a fresh experience. The food is always fresh and in it's proportioned correctness. A large french fry will have more fries than a medium size. Imagine that. "" I am loving it""."
22025,29,a year ago,3 stars,This McDonald's is right by my house and really the only reason I continue to go. Service is excellent but I'm missing something from my order every single time I go. Having to go thru the hassle of getting out and going inside really defeats the purpose of going through the drive thru
22026,29,9 months ago,1 star,"Just avoid. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had with a McDonald's. I feel like you have to be trying to be terrible to be as bad as this location. There are other McDonald's close by, don't bother with this place."
22027,29,6 years ago,4 stars,The best looking McDonald's I have ever visited. Located near the zoo. Friendly staff and fast service.
22028,29,10 months ago,4 stars,"Was good service, would've been better if we wasn't walking around a homeless person passed out on the sidewalk was strange for sure"
22029,29,8 months ago,1 star,"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS MCDONALDS.
I ORDERED 4 MEALS THROUGH UBER EATS
AND ALL I GOT WAS THE BURGERS
NO FRIES
NO SAUCES
NO DRINKS!!!!
I EVEN ORDERED A MCFLURRY.
ALL I GOT WAS BURGERS."
22030,29,a year ago,3 stars,"The staff works super hard, but the zoo/location deters from it shining. Keep the great job up, day staff. The night staff needs to brush up."
22031,29,5 months ago,1 star,Why remove the animals??.. This remodel looks cold & uninviting.. Horrible
22032,29,a year ago,2 stars,"Food was definitely not even close to being fresh ""ish""and the location, although you'd think is convenient after visiting the zoo ... It's a wreck waiting to happen if you try to drive in to their location."
22033,29,3 years ago,5 stars,Friendly management and staff. Ready to make sure you are satisfied with your order.
22034,29,3 years ago,5 stars,Cute place to bring the kids. Never seen a McDonalds like this one
22035,29,a year ago,5 stars,The employees were very friendly. Our order was correct. The food was hot and fresh. The tables were clean. My kids were happy.  Thanks for a great lunch!
22036,29,3 years ago,4 stars,Love the French fries. The coffee drinks are great! Excellent place for small children. They do have healthy good for the kiddos. Fun place to play. Many treasured memories with my little grandson. (He's 20 now!)
22037,29,5 months ago,1 star,Who idea was it to destroy the famous zoo McDonalds ??? I hope revenue sales go down the drain.
22038,29,8 months ago,5 stars,My kids love going to this McDonald!!! Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a zoo McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
22039,29,a year ago,5 stars,Super friendly staff which is so different when it comes to Mc Donald staff. Every time I go there they seem so happy to be at work and serve. So refreshing. Plus the morning staff manager is so on point and the staff really reflect them well.
22040,29,a year ago,4 stars,"It would be nice if the play place was open again but it's not so that was disappointing. It's clean, employees are nice, got my order right."
22041,29,3 years ago,5 stars,"I went there this afternoon with my almost 3 year old. The food was fast, made right the first time and was good. The staff was wonderful and the restaurant was clean and the animals were amazing. I could not compliment this place anymore. If we lived here we would go here a lot."
22042,29,a year ago,5 stars,"Although they kept forgetting stuff,the ladies were nice and quick with our food. Super upbeat,love the environment!"
22043,29,6 years ago,1 star,In drive through at 10:58 AM- tried ordering lunch. I was told they couldn't take my order. I told them I'd just wait 2 minutes... LIke the car ahead of me that took 5 minutes to order. No big deal right? Nope manager comes out and yells at me to move/pull around she didn't care... I just had to move. 1 car was behind me still ordering. Would have thought I was blocking a fire escape or something. By the time I actually got through the drive through (due to cars ahead of me) it was 11:01AM... Really smart move guys. I'll happily take my business elsewhere. No longer stopping by after zoo trips with the kids.
22044,29,3 weeks ago,5 stars,Food was good and fresh
22045,29,9 months ago,5 stars,Had a great time the  family here .  Very friendly environment  and the food qas great
22046,29,4 years ago,5 stars,"I haven't been to McDonald's in years and I was surprised how good it was. I have the southwest salad and it was great. I don't know if I would go back for another few years, but I was pleasantly surprised. Also the staff here was super sweet with my little girl to ask to trade in her toy from her happy meal."
22047,29,5 years ago,1 star,"I work five minutes away from this store, so I go there all the time. Everytime I go there's a problem. This time my bun was so hard. The bottom bun. There's always something wrong. I worked for this same company for a lot of years,(swing manager). It's crazy. I've only got good service once or twice there."
22048,29,11 months ago,1 star,Did not know that at this mc Donald u have to wait 30 min to get your dam order wat happen to fast food when you went and left 10 min later its crazy
22049,29,4 years ago,5 stars,"Hot fresh fries and the frosty machine is up and working  after 9 pm? I know, it's unheard of right? Well I had a really great experience at this location. Staff was professional and pleasant and the food is yum!
Thank you everyone."
22050,29,a year ago,3 stars,"The staffs were wonderful,  but the dining area was cramped.   Too many table and chair in a tiny place.  Especially for Covid season."
22051,29,2 months ago,5 stars,Very fast friendly service
22052,29,4 years ago,4 stars,"This is an American classic serving up hot and fresh fast food favorites. I like this location because the people are always nice, and the service is always fast. This is really good if you have a short lunch break and need to make the most of your time."
22053,29,2 years ago,1 star,"Worse Mcdonalds Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve been to! Took forever with my order even though it was super slow (2 cars in drive-thru), parking lot is full of trash, we ate in parking lot and I went inside for a refill on my drink and they said they donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"
22054,29,3 years ago,4 stars,"I've been going there for many years as they are close to where I live. They are consistently decent. They usually get it right, it's normally fairly fresh...it is McDonald's so... They do make a darned good cup of coffee, which is what brings me back usually. I generally think of coffee when I think of Mickey D's."
22055,29,2 years ago,1 star,Worst people ever. The girls were being rude for no reason. The zoo theme outside is very nice but the customer service was the worst. We asked a question and she slammed the window on us
22056,29,6 years ago,1 star,Wow!!  Today I went through the drive thru.  The cashier freaked out when I presented a discount coupon.   The cashier told me the receipt printer was out of paper.  When I pulled forward to the food pickup window.  I informed them and requested my receipt.  It turns out the cashier was lying just hiding the fact I was charge double on my credit card.  I waited 7 additional minutes for my tiny order to be prepared.  I brought to their attention about the overcharge.  They said to call and they will take care of it over the phone.  I have been calling the entire day.  No answer.
22057,29,6 years ago,2 stars,"Awful experience. It was 10:15 and I needed a sweet tea and nuggets. I order my tea in the drive through line. The line was pretty long. When I got to the window to pay the cashier with light brown eyes, said they could only take cash. I said, what!!! I have stayed in this line this long and no one said a word!! I said, for my inconvenience I would like to have the tea. She looked strange, and I said please let me speak to your manager. She spoke to someone, and the manager said no and wouldn't come to the window. AWFUL!!!"
22058,29,3 years ago,4 stars,"This was a good McD. They made a good product that wasn't smashed in a bag and thrown out the window. They actually salted the fries, that's a lost art anymore. And the girl at the window was sweet and full of smiles. Obviously a happy crew does better work."
22059,29,3 years ago,3 stars,"Not the best McDonald's I've been too. First off, it could have been cleaner, they needed to sweep the floors. Second, the staff weren't the friendliest. I went up to the register and the man just said not yet. Never greeted me or give me a reason. Then I waited like 10 mins then a lady took my order, she was a bit nicer. Then waited another 10 mins for my food to come. I get being busy but at least be a bit friendlier or tell me theres gonna be a wait"
22060,29,a year ago,4 stars,Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve used the drive through only. Service is great. I love the outd
22061,29,3 years ago,1 star,"Zari was absolutely incompetent! We specifically ordered 4 meals to be placed in 4 separate bags during the first stage of ordering (as they were for 4 people). When we requested this again at her window, she rolled her eyes, huffed, and began changing them out. She also gave me 3 Cokes and 1 diet Coke (for the diabetic in the group). They didn't mark the diet Coke so she told us that it was the wrong one! Luckily there was no need for a hospital visit due to her total lack of concern for safety and health!"
22062,29,8 months ago,2 stars,"Always something with this location. Either system down, only cash or sometimes no respond on the drive thru at nights"
22063,29,a year ago,1 star,Well what can I say I use to work mc Donalds and their custermer  service  was great I went to drive through  tonight no one help me on the speaker so I drove  to the window the cashier tell no that will need to go back in line and order again that he could get my order at the window I was in line for good 10 15 mn then I go to  the window to talk to manger nothing and he just left to the back and ignored  the custermer in the front he was asking for him to get him something  he did not get any help he left I drove up then he was not there at all with a big line I went back to the drive thru and well to oder then he tel their is no ice scream so I get inline again for nothing had to stay in line until they served every one in front and again no one in the windows to help  but just the some  need to ck cause I have it all in video  I will posting it on line to she how horrible  custermer service  Mc Donald's  have compare to Chick-fil-A  they don't come close of the quality  and custermer service they have and people need to start speaking about  Mc how not only tge drive thru people wait for 20 to 30 mn some all the pollution but that's another story I hope this makes some ck this out
22064,29,a year ago,4 stars,I like coming to this location the morning team is always kind & friendly...the night team has more younger team members some of them have great customer service..but the only thing that stopped me from rating 5 stars the point system I've had trouble several times adding my code to gain point for my purchase ...and reached out to McDonald's customer service and was told someone would contact me but that hasn't happened ï¿½ï¿½
22065,29,7 months ago,3 stars,Just bought the new adult happy meal for a little over 10 per meal!!! Way to expensive.
22066,29,4 years ago,3 stars,"Didnt have the toys for happy meal that they had out in display, disappointing for 3 yr old. The jungle theme is cool esp for kids. Playground was clean and fun. Employees didnt seem to like their job, nor people."
22067,29,2 years ago,1 star,"Went today after the zoo, it was a very bad experience to say the least.
We were given over seasoned  fries, one straw for three drinks, and the drinks were all bad.
I thought how do you mess up a drink?
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee.
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction.
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries.
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke... It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids!!
Will not ever return."
22068,29,6 years ago,4 stars,"This is a wonderful wildlife themed location right next to the Dallas Zoo and perfect for bringing children for lunch before heading off to the zoo. The staff is always friendly here, the management is good and the restaurant is much cleaner and well run than most McDonald's in the area. Prices are typical of the food chain, service is fast and the food is usually above average for fast food. Can't go wrong here, especially with the kids. They will love it."
22069,29,5 years ago,1 star,"Doesn't deserve one star! Waited in line 30 minutes. When we finally ordered the girl couldn't get the order right after 3 attempts. When we got to the pay window, the girl was talking on her cell phone. When I asked her to repeat my order, she looked at me crazy. When we got our order it was disgusting. Soggy oily fries, burned chicken nuggets, water down soda ... plain disgusting. They need new management for sure!!! Someone please contact corporate!!!!!"
22070,29,7 years ago,4 stars,"Very nice fancy ""CLEAN"" restrooms, that's a plus! Very clean lobby area and nice play area for children, just no hooks on the restroom doors to hang our coat, jacket or purse. Overall it's a well managed McDonald's compared to others I seen. :) A-1 rating I also love the Dallas Zoo theme! It's a tourist attraction. Thank you McDonald's for your professionalism in management and customer service. (Please put restroom door hooks up for our coat, jacket, diaper bag and/or purse, thanks!)"
22071,29,3 years ago,1 star,These teenagers with bad customer service have the worst attitudes and are lazy. I bet the hiring manager is the same way considering her terrible hires. I wouldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t give this place one star. The only good person Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
22072,29,a year ago,3 stars,"Fast service, maybe  a little too fast ..I  recommend you get them to repeat your order . Either they need better headphones or don't comprehend your order."
22073,29,a year ago,1 star,I ordered a 6 piece nuggets and 3 chocolate chip cookies I got my nuggets and had to wait 15 minutes for the cookies I had to call and let them know I was still waiting in reserve 1
22074,29,9 months ago,1 star,I was disappointed that the play area was closed due to it being filthy and the speakers were blown so the animal noises were bursts of LOUD static.
22075,29,2 years ago,5 stars,"I rate this place five stars cuz these guys do deserve it, the food was hot fresh and exciting still to this day! And yes I knw we all ate pretty much everything @ McDonald's, but these guys put there love into cause still to this day, I want another one... And no one has made my hamburger like you guys, and I really appreciate that. Thank you McDonald's, I'll be back! And shout out to the manager who helped me and my family that day. Thank you!"
22076,29,2 years ago,3 stars,"Good people, The speakers or mic's are terrible
I have to fix my order at the window everytime I go here, makes me think they mess up my order in the end just out of spite that, they think I'm changing my order every time I go.

Dear Manager

FIX/ REPAIR or GET SOME NEW EQUIPMENT PLEASE"
22077,29,6 years ago,1 star,Worst experience ever. I pay for large fries and only fill it half way. I said if I want a medium I'll pay for a medium. Now fill this up or give me my money back. Service is just the worst I've seen. I really recommend people to not go there. Waste of time and will leave you with a headache
22078,29,2 years ago,2 stars,"Same ol"" ready in 2 minutes food. Idk how they do it . But ramen needs to step up their game because it takes longer to cook noodles in the microwave . Great Job Mickey D's"
22079,29,3 years ago,1 star,"My wife and I was going to this McDonald's for some morning when they had another crew. But here recently they changed the morning to a new crew(an old man, a young vanity lady at the drive through window that is very rude). This crew need to be removed. They never seemed to know how to work and prepare your order in a timely manner. This facility is also made where you can't just get out of line in the drive through which is very dangerous if a car stalls or a real emergency arrives. We will be skipping visiting the morning crew. Plz. change crew or train them better."
22080,29,4 years ago,1 star,"Would have have it a negative if possible. I have went to this location for the last time. Drive through you will sit at the speaker for 2 minutes before they even say anything to you but you can hear them talking/laughing/and cursing to each other. POOR MANAGEMENT. THEN, my order was wrong so I go inside to get a refund only to see my receipt had about 15 streks of ink on it nothing legible. SO I go inside and say I would like my money back and the manager just shrugs me off like it doesn't effect her. If you are going to the Dallas Zoo drive further and don't let this McDonald's ruin your day. TRUST ME."
22081,29,6 years ago,1 star,"Horrible place....rude employees, burnt fries, and fudge sundae had fudge all over top and outside of plastic top. ."
22082,29,4 years ago,4 stars,"McDonald's is McDonald's. Consistent menu/ food quality. What sepates this location from other's is decor and friendly staff that do a great job with order taking, getting it out quickly and keeping area clean. Besides the large play structure this location is an extension of the zoo experience with  models of a giraffe nibbling leaves from a tree containing a huge snake, a  touchable cheetah statue and chatterbox chimp. Great place to go with kids."
22083,29,4 years ago,5 stars,Well its very clean with good food.i recomend the number 6 mcgriddle
22084,29,5 years ago,1 star,"Be careful with young children here! We had a women approach our booth and asked personal questions about my young niece while my brother was getting the food. We tried to dismiss her and did not answer her questions, but she just sat herself in our booth uninvited. We asked her to leave several times, because it was very uncomfortable. She just continued to sit and stare at my neice. We made it clear we were having a private lunch and would like her to leave.
Then the women's boyfriend called her back to his table, she left us and then they walked out shortly after.
Another patron approached us after the women left our table because she believed the women was planning to abduct my niece. She noticed the women staring at my niece and told us to be safe. When we left they were parked next to our truck as well. We will definitely not be going back there."
22085,29,5 years ago,1 star,Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! We saw previous customers coming back to get their orders fixed. Every table in the play place was awful. (Ours had spilled milk). The employee took one trash can out but didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t pick up the trays and didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t clean up the busted bbq sauce on the floor. What was also bad was that we moved to another table and the floor was covered with napk
22086,29,6 months ago,1 star,Terrible for getting rid of the zoo decor.
22087,29,4 months ago,5 stars,Good food nice place
22088,29,a year ago,4 stars,I'm guessing that this location is a training hub or something. It seems like it's always some kind of trouble when it comes to order food show code on app for food pay and go.

22089,29,5 years ago,1 star,"***Deserves No Stars What So Ever !***

This Place Is By Far The Worst! The drive threw lady  on 12/6/17 was absolutely rude! I came  to get some breakfast around 10:45 she continusly kept asking me"" is that it?"" I asked for a minute to see the menu. Then within a ""Second"" she asked if I was done with my order!  Sausage burritos had No Sausage. Orange Juice Cups Were Only Filled Half Way. Hash browns were cold ! By far the worst service ever! Your management needs to  work on their employees attitudes !"
22090,29,2 years ago,5 stars,"Hey guys,  want a quick little pick me up for brunch? Order an apple pie , wait till you get home to heat it. Spread a little butter on it, pop it in microwave  for seconds . Top with  ice cream...don't for get coffee!...now that's a nice little something,  for a little bit of nothing...all at the Mac.."
22091,29,4 years ago,5 stars,Passing through from a volleyball tournament.   Great tasting food with friendly service.  Had bagel nice and hot with fresh hashbrowns.  Definitely recommend if hungry and needing to feed a family fast on budget.
22092,29,3 years ago,2 stars,"Well it might have been ok, if I was not rushing, but I still stayed for my items. For this to be McDonald's, they should know that it's busier during certain hours then others..there were soo many ppl in line, the average person would have turn right back around n walked out."
22093,29,3 years ago,2 stars,The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and napkins. Even after you've ask. Then soon as you drive away.  You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied to.
22094,29,2 years ago,5 stars,"Awesome, super nice staff!! We stopped by every Mc to get the BTS meal. Only this place has the special paper bag!! Even the BTS pic!!! Thank you so much."
22095,29,3 years ago,4 stars,I liked it cause its right by the zoo and my daughter loves to play but the staff there can be a bit abrasive after a zoo event like the Halloween trick or treat event they we understaffed and ran out of a flavor of soda and large drinks and I payed for a large but only got a medium they should have just made the fries large but the guy running the register seemed kinda new
22096,29,4 years ago,4 stars,"I love going to this McDonalds by the Dallas Zoo cause they have these animals that make noise and look like a jungle in there. Today we were there around 7pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for. The only thing I didn't like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy, I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy. I know why McDonald's do this but it's not the employees fault."
22097,29,2 years ago,1 star,The employees are very rude one of them snatched a bag out of my boyfriends hands because they messed up our order and when we complained to the manager she laughed and did nothing about it. I would expect better seeing is how itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï
22098,29,5 years ago,3 stars,"This McDonald's is by the Dallas zoo.  Kids were hungry after the Christmas lights at night event at the zoo.   Went there and found it alright. Service was relative quick but the store itself was quite dirty. Play place looked like it hasn't been wiped, and most likely haven't been sanitized. Bathrooms needed fixing and also dirty.  Hope management can quickly fix since parents want to come by for it's convenient location next to the zoo"
22099,29,6 months ago,1 star,They are remodeling it and it won't look cool anymore ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
22100,29,3 years ago,1 star,Their icecream machine was broke. They didnt have any toys for the happymeals. The tables were disgusting. And I counldnt understand the cashier. Plus she was using 2 registers at once!!!!! If i could give negative stars i would!
22101,29,3 years ago,5 stars,A couple years ago at 5 am I went here pregnant and got an egg mcmuffin when i got home to eat it and go to bed it was dripping with grease. Today i ordered a 20piece chicken nuggets and 3 large fries they were all served fresh and i only waited a few minutes.
22102,29,4 years ago,1 star,"This mc donalds is very slow and the employees are rude and always have an attitude when you ask to get your order fresh . I always count on this mc donalds not to mess up with my order but they ALWAYS do . Also they tell you to wait on the 1 or 2 waiting spot but never come out with your food . Today i ordered chicken nuggets and asked for them to be fresh , they were ok until i noticed that the chicken was BLACK inside one of the nuggets . Maybe was black inside of more of them and i didnt notice . I have picture proof as well . This mc donalds is just trash ."
22103,29,a year ago,5 stars,"Stopped in late around 1am but received good service, area  around drive thru was clean despite age of building and outdated signage for the play place but received order and the team member even placed an extra sauce I requested at the window in a separate bag instead of trying to shove 5 in my hand like most do."
22104,29,5 years ago,5 stars,"Neatest McDonald's I've ever been to (except maybe one in Roswell, NM), the jungle zoo theme is awesome. Food was good, service was great. Even gave us a free drink, very kind."
22105,29,5 years ago,1 star,"Very Disappointed, 40 minutes to get my food due to short of staff per shift leader. No manager to get my money refunded. I've waited in the drive-thru. No apology whatsoever from that shift leader.  Will call coporate office myself.  My order was all screwed up."
22106,29,3 years ago,5 stars,"I buy my drinks there. The Management staff there does not have a problem giving me honey with my coffee. The Managers and their staff are always asking their patrons is everything ok and will address small problems with a smile , even the homeless. Not like the rude manager that I have reported twice on (Robert B Cullom 75215 in South dallas) and I never heared anything back from McDonald about that !!!! As she stated they are only going to redirect you back to me . Since I haven't heard anything back Im going on Social Media about that manager in the South Dallas McDonald's"
22107,29,5 years ago,1 star,"The drive thru took forever and it was 10p!! The young attendant felt the need to chat with the car in front of me for a full 7 mins. Doesn't sound ridiculous until you're sitting there watching it with a full line of impatient cars behind you. Then when I pulled up the kid realized he never handed back the guy's credit card, and started laughing about it. His co-worker was shaking her head saying ""it was cuz you got distracted talking to him about guns for so long"" ...
To add insult to injury, I got my food, I had to remind the kid about my drinks that I ordered, I left, and my food was cold and my order was wrong."
22108,29,a year ago,5 stars,If you like a lively staff who can make you smile and have a good laugh this is the McDonald for you.  They were very pleasant and funny.
22109,29,a year ago,3 stars,We really like this Mc Donalds. It's special because of its jungle theme.  But lately the staff has been on the rude side.
22110,29,2 years ago,1 star,"Horrible service, I'm just done with McDonald's. I tried a few different locations and apparently none of them can offer a friendly service i will just take my money somewhere else."
22111,29,8 years ago,1 star,"A worker called MY order number so obviously I'm gonna grab it. It didn't even occur to me to look at the tray the only thing I noticed was that I was missing a coffee so I set the tray on the table and on my way back I see the manager yelling at my family about how WE grabbed the wrong order and see at first we tried being cool about it. She said she was taking back the extra food and we said that was fine so then she starts grabbing the food we ordered and says we weren't charged for that, after an interesting conversation we establish that my receipt clearly said I was charged. Ten minutes later they've manned to give two BIG orders but haven't managed to give me a bacon egg mcgriddle. So eventually I get the burger and as the manager hands it to me she's telling a worker she gave us 8 hash browns. I obviously heard her and said ""no ma'am, we got 4"" this same manager then has the audacity to say we already ate them. At this point I'm pissed. I've been accused of not paying for my part of the food, I'm hungry, I've waited way too long, the manager has an attitude, AND she's a accusing my family of eating 4 hash browns in less than a minute. NEVER eating at this McDonald's again. Especially with a manager like that."
22112,29,8 years ago,1 star,"I eat at this McDonalds at least 4 times a week. Never again. The service is always questionable and the drive thru order is screwed up as often as not. Had to wait at drive-thru order 5 full minutes before giving my order. That's at the speaker, not in line. Was told (rather rudely) to wait several times. When given the order, the server practically threw the bag at me and disappeared. When I got to work, I found I had to eat my hotcakes with no plasticware, no syrup or butter and not even a napkin. Calls placed to the store went unanswered. Poor service all around."
22113,29,3 years ago,2 stars,Burgers are always flat. Good for on the road food. I sure do miss the dollar menus tho. And they charge for mayo if you add it but not if you get packets.. humm
22114,29,5 years ago,1 star,Worst experience ever!! They closed the lobby early!! Then the manager found out people were still coming in and started yelling!! The nice officer apologized for her attitude and gave us complimentary drinks for patiently waiting for our burger. She needs to go over a customer service training again or find another job!!
22115,29,3 years ago,1 star,"9/3/18 @ 1:50pm I came by McDonalds today and I went through the drive through the girl that takes your order did not even bother to Greet me and take my order she was just talking so much I guess she did not know she was gossiping and knew we can hear her but she was saying the most rudest things through speaker, it seems like she was talking to another employer. I kept saying helloo hellooo helloo and did not even bother to stop talking. Then when I pulled up to the first window the one that was so rude was the one that has a ring in her nose she is african american she did not even bother to repeat my order and did not offer to give me receipt. There was another girl next to her biting off her Acrylic Nails and was falling all over the table where the order computer were at SO DISGUSTING! I used to work here things have changed and these ghetto girls are so RUDE! At the pick up window that lady was so sweet she had a smile and greated us well."

22120,29,3 years ago,5 stars,Fancy Mcdonalds.  Zoo theme nice.  Everybody friendly. Had a hard working young man named Nathan.  He was doing everything. Working hard.  All over the restaurant.  Just wanted to let him know somebody noticed.
22121,29,2 years ago,4 stars,Busy place but the people who served us were friendly and polite. More expensive than other McDonald's I visit. I am guessing this is because it is near the Dallas Zoo.

22126,29,4 years ago,4 stars,Very unique McDonald's. They have all sorts of animal statues around that make random noises while you eat. The play place is unique and the outside of the place has so many cool photo opportunities. The food is typical McDonald's.

22131,29,2 years ago,1 star,The employees cannot count for nothing. On top of that the coffee tasted like cardboard it's very obvious they do not clean their machines. Disgusting store.
22132,29,5 years ago,4 stars,"It's the perfect place to finish a long day at the Dallas Zoo. This animal themed McDonald's has a very large play ground area and plenty of tables and seats to watch the kids while they play. The food and service was adequate although the bathroom could have been a a little cleaner. All in all, it's different enough and the kids liked it enough that we will likely come back after our next visit to the Dallas Zoo."
22133,29,5 years ago,1 star,Good food. I waited 15 minutes for one bacon cheeseburger. The store is very sloppy it look like a hurricane came through. They were understaffed. I deserve a free meal for that experience.
22134,29,a year ago,3 stars,"Kids loved the zoo theme, especially after just leaving the zoo.Order was wrong,but friendly customer service"
22135,29,5 years ago,2 stars,My family and I get to this McDonald's we are shocked it looked so nice from the outside and they have the jungle themed play house. I ask if they have an outlet so that I may charge my laptop and phone and no. The Wi-Fi here is not even strong enough. I could not complete my homework.  Bummed out.  Not the best as usual.
22136,29,3 years ago,5 stars,Great food great staff....I stop there several times each week for breakfast and the food always arrives fast/ fresh/delicious and the staff always remembers me. Highly Highly Recommend this location!
22137,29,5 years ago,4 stars,My 3yo granddaughter loved this place. The play land is well designed with plenty of room for active exercise and the larger than life zoo animal motif delighted her.
22138,29,4 years ago,2 stars,The customer service is just not what it used to be. There is no Welcome to McDonalds just how can i help. I ended up payimg for someone elses order. At 1st i thought it was more but it was 20 cents less. I'm glad i only go there for drinks.
22139,29,5 years ago,1 star,The service was alful everyone working the front was either on there phone or joking around. They got my order wrong twice. New management is needed and a whole new crew to go with it.

RESTROOM WAS SO nasty ,with wet stuff all over the floor, no toilet paper and toilets were nasty.We walked out of the restroom, I told hubby no tissue paper .He said let's go this whole place is nasty. Trash can was overflowing around the floor ,all tables dirty and and no jungle sounds coming from the animals .. Disgusting.

22155,29,3 years ago,5 stars,"McDonalds is great! It is a sure thing. You know you what to expect. Today I was surprised! A new burger caught my eye. It is a Spain inspired burger. I was hesitant about buy in it. This was new and well it could be great or ruin my lunch BUT I took a chance aaand!!! Oh my goodness!!! It was sooooooooo yummy! I mean it was so yummy that I hardly touched my delicious fries! Well, my normal favorite is the quarter pounder with cheese .... today it was that Spain inspired burger. I guess it was the cheese or the sauce(normally I don't like sauces on my burger) but I don't know if it was the combination of bacon, the different cheeses or what, but it was soooo good. Yum I will have to come back to this McDonalds. I don't think they sell this burger in just any McDonalds, I think it has to be in one of the safari themed ones. Anyway it was really good! It made my day! I was happy the rest of my meetings and sessions. Normally it would be boring but hey my tummy was cheerful and so was I."

the temperature was warm inside there for the activity needs to be cooler. The outside ketchup dispensers don't work and the servers get upset when you ask for more ketchup or sauces. If I order a 20pc chicken nugget and 4 med fries I will need more than 2 bbq sauce and 4 packages of ketchup. Plus a Vagrant was hitting people up for money inside the restaurant. Not going back ever again you guys need to clean up that place"

While waiting at the window someone started yelling at the employee in which he stopped to yell back and call her a bit** and tell her that someone named bebe won't be in till 5. Highly inappropriate and I felt I should have drove off which would have been the better decision. No one should ever go here and they should rethink the staff
22181,29,5 years ago,1 star,Doesn't deserve a single star. My burger was slopply made and half sticking out of the box. Way to much pepper poured on the chicken and gave us a drink instead of a shake that I ordered. By far the worse mcdonalds in Texas area. Would never come back and rather drive out of Dallas to order my food at another Mcdonalds.

23053,29,3 years ago,5 stars,"For the first time I see such a McDonald's, made either under Madagascar, or just like the Jungle. The lion growls, the elephant trumpets periodically, the boa constrictor hisses, the children like it. But there is no self-order screen. Civilization, apparently, has not yet reached this forest with animals."
23054,29,3 months ago,4 stars,It was prettier when I had the animals recently I went and the lady who was cleaning bothered me because she was complaining about her work with hints as if I had dirty everything and be careful I always pick up my garbage and my children's even when we arrived we cleaned the table where we did not sit because it was dirty and also when I was leaving in the bathroom I found her again and again with her hints what a pity with this lady
23055,29,a month ago,1 star,"What bad people to give orders, I made my order and it was 25.04 dollars and 4 cents and the cashier told me you want to leave the change and I told her, I'll leave you the koras and give me the 4 dollars and she tells me that I only gave him 26 dollars when I gave him 30 dollars because they are so like that.."

23084,20,3 years ago,5 stars,Restaurant was clean. Ordering at a kiosk was pretty impersonal but the cashier was nice. I didn't like my breakfast choice - it looked like an english muffin with sausage. But the muffin was very soft and tasted like syrup. Yuck. My sweet tea was weak at best.

23090,20,4 months ago,1 star,It's McDonald's so I don't expect much if anything but the people running this one don't have a care in the world. Staff walking around in the back wearing scruffy old pyjamas looking street wear. (ie not the uniform and not even clean looking personal clothes) No hairnets. Kiosks not working. Slow service at the counter and long wait for food. Missing items. I could go on.

First we waited in one of the drive through lane for over 15 minutes just to find out it was out our order. No signs and no one notifying the customers. The other lane was long so I parked and ordered online for curbside pick up.

23097,20,4 months ago,1 star,I went today to get food and they said two times they were not open. It clearly states they are open 24 hours.

Just give me an answer.
23098,20,3 months ago,1 star,"Came here at 4 in the morning and they told me they are closed, but right before I drove up to the window there was another guy Infront of me that they served.

All that in front of the manager ..

Besides that waiting time was ridiculous long with a lot of customers not satisfied and even a uber eats guy had to cancel in front of  me because they didn't make his order in more than 20 min that I was there ...

Another lady in the back was not using the yellow paper that sandwiches have she was placing the  buns/bread directly on the table as she was preparing food for dogs. She saw me and start acting like nothing happened..

This place is a completely mess

Then in the next lane someone pulled up had waited 5 seconds before someone took their order before me who had be been waiting. They charged me the wrong food and never got my correct receipt. Next window they lost my order and then got it wrong after I said very clearly what i wanted and it wasn't a complicated order just two burgers.
23135,20,a year ago,4 stars,Fairly clean majority of the time. I guess that depends on who's working. But the customer service is pretty fair in all my experiences here. For a quick bite. I prefer this specific McDonald's. Food is always fresh. And I never have to ask for napkins.

I ordered and then had to wait 30 minutes this was so crazy and then I asked to speak with a manager and then I had to wait about another 15 min and then no staff members would speak English. They all need an attitude adjustment. I will never ever go to this Mcdonald's again never ever had to wait 45 min for a cup of coffee!!!! Please don't go and spend your money here!!!

23146,20,a year ago,1 star,"I ordered takeout from the McDonald's app. After waiting at least 20 minutes they finally talked to me and asked about my order. I said that I put my order in through the app. They said that because their system was down they could not give me the food that I paid for. I spent ten dollars and wasted a half hour of my life. I have had to complain to corporate, I have had to talk to a manager via email. Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution. If I left a McDonald's with ten dollars worth of food they would have me arrested but because I am a customer they are fine with stealing my money and my time. This is a terrible McDonald's and because of this experience I will no longer be going to any McDonald's in the future."

While paying with my card through the drive thru the cashier said I had to give her my pin number because the pad didn't reach out the window. I've NEVER had something like that happen to me anywhere in my life. Not a single employee had on a uniform. Just a total messed up experience

Not once did she wash her hands, but had the nerve to be mad at me because your coworker didn't ring up the order correctly. Definitely will not be coming back to this one.

Honestly, if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last.

I spent an hour in the drive-thru and when I got to the window it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered.

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing. It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all. Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion, it was a sight to see.

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was, of course, not correct. But the weird thing is they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries.

After  my order was done, they made me wait on the sidewalk and let other cars go ahead of me just because I was not in a car.

When I called at the store, they picked up the call. But when I start complain about this situations, they hung up on my face!  This McDonald used to be so good and professional.
I don't know what happened.
since they changed to new staff, got worse ."

23214,20,4 years ago,1 star,"Drive thru cashier completely got my order wrong.  She order what she saw on register and not what I wanted.  Then look surprised when I told her.  The manager should not let her work drive thru. Which explains why the line was so long.  I'm sure I'm not the only order she screwed up. Don't normally post these comments,  but it's becoming more of the norm these days."

23216,20,3 years ago,1 star,no stars!!! this is the worst ever service i have ever encountered 28 minutes in the drive-thru. I asked for a refund and the managers name and they refunded me my money and decline to give me the food. I ask the manager for her name and she walks away.... at the end i got my food for free but perhaps a better management team needs to come in and train cus these young women that were there yesterday 6/23 around 2pm were exchanging snapchat videos and chitchatting like they didnt have 8-10 cars in the drive thru

23221,20,2 years ago,1 star,"Biscayne Blvd., and 35th Street
Based upon what I observed and experienced at the drive-thru window with 4 employees (one who couldn't even understand or speak English), I made a complaint to McDonald's yesterday and will wait to hear from someone with the franchise owner's organization.  The owner needs to know how poorly managed this restaurant is, and how inadequately the employees are trained to do their jobs.  I also have contacted and submitted a written complaint to Chris Kempczinski, CEO of McDonald's, as well as Steve Easterbrook who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonald's in Chicago.  They need to understand why McDonald's is doing so poorly; afterall, when they have to communicate to their Board members and investors about a drop in multiple quarterly revenues and earnings over the past year, maybe then they will take a look at how poorly they select, train and manage their employees to create a positive customer experience with stellar service. I will not be going to this, or any other, McDonald's again!  It was that bad.  McDonald's corporation needs to do a thorough investigation of how this restaurant is NOT being properly managed by the franchise owner and managers.  The owner clearly must put numbers before people.  Horrible, horrible experience!  Will stick with Wendy's instead.  They have much better food and service!

04/05/2021 - As a follow-up to my complaint to McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s 1-800#, and the CEO, I did receive a written response and phone call.  Kathy was very appreciative of the feedback received and thorough in her explanation of actions taken as a result of a completed investigation.  I was also compensated for the experience I had at this McDonaldï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s.

I drove around the front this morning and they had about four employees there looking at me . One of them gave me a thumbs up to go back to the drive-through which I did and it was the same result the lady did not answer and finally I decided I would leave, and right before I left she answered by saying one moment please so I waited hey moment and she still was not ready so I just left . There have been two vehicles in the drive-through before me that had also left and I did not understand why until my experience. I believe the employees are slacking off in the morning which is difficult for me because if I don't have breakfast then I have to wait 6 1/2 hours at work before they allow me to go eat ."

First the whole staff hates thier jobs and second the wait time for your food is like 30 mins or more, between them doing your order and all the uber eats, postmates and grubhub also waiting to pick up orders. Its a mess. They are understaffed and everything is wrong at this location."
23237,20,3 years ago,4 stars,"This is what I call one of those 50/50 places. the food quality is always good, it's the people inside, specifically sometimes you have homeless sitting at a table, or a very loud bunch of drunk adults ( kids I don't mind, that's what they are suppose to do). there is nothing they can do, but I still get my order and eat at my scooter outside. not fun but what can you do."
23238,20,5 years ago,2 stars,"I like the new design but the customer service has gone down hill. Way too many employees go there on their day off to socialize, they hang around the registers distracting emplyees who should be focused on their stations and tending to customers. The worst part is that one of the managers (a young latino kid) was engaged in of these conversations. I asked the manager why he wasn't controlling his staff and he just looked at me and laughed."

23247,20,6 years ago,1 star,The worst experience.  Staff and management ignored the customers. Talked to each other.  Took 10 minutes to order.  Then 10 minutes to get my food.  No apology.  Management watched and said nothing during this whole ordeal.  Total rude and unprofessional.

Sadly, this is the only one which is near my home and sometimes I don't have options to chose another one but, today, was the last straw. I made an order through the app and selected the pickup at the Drive Thru but when I got to the screen where we should order, the girl who was there didn't know what to do with my Order Code and when I got to the window and ask for it they didnt know anything neither and they pretended that I went inside because they do not dispatch mobile order by there. Also told me that the payment had not come through and I requested to cancel the order but, 3 minutes later I was charged with the order that I never got so, Im  making this complain because I am pretty upset and disappointed because I always eat in Mc. Donalds but in this store is always the same disgusting and poor service at all time or unless when I have gone: mornings and nights. Also, I disputed the charge you made to my credit card because, as you noticed, I never got it."

Drive-thru menu: half the screen was off and the drive thru lady could not comprehend that - even as I pulled into the store and told her. She didn't get what was happening.

They still get annoyed because they called me by the order number, when I was sitting at the other end and didn't even notice, until I complained to them 35 minutes later!!! Either they correct the app or better train the staff."
24041,20,a year ago,1 star,"Bad service in the disgusting place of churre, the supervisors who have to set an example, just gossip and speak ill of the clients, I don't know how the owners do not come as a surprise. There are people who really deserve the job. Hygiene shines. .hand sanitizer empty"

24043,20,2 months ago,1 star,"In the night shift 9 / 10 they are taken as a break because several times I have gone and they say that it is ""closed"", and the service has always been very, extremely slow and late... but it is the one that is close to me and no way , but without a doubt one of the worst in the whole country"
24044,20,a year ago,1 star,"It is the third time we go at night and they don't let us in to eat. We always go before 10:00 pm, today we arrived at 10:05 pm and they literally slammed the door in our faces, and on the door it says it's until 11 pm. If you don't have dine in after 10 pm please change your hours on the website and at the door of the place!"

The worst MacDonald in the United States, they are a shame, the bad treatment they give to customers, I was in the second line, 3 cars passed by from the first and they didn't serve me When my turn came, they yelled at me because I ordered in Spanish. I asked to speak to the manager, he told me NO, then my 9-year-old daughter asked for her order in English and told her that she was not going to sell and said a bad word to her...I had I explained to the manager that they called him and in front of her he treated me badly for not speaking English, a very bad attitude from that person... how sad with so many people who need to work, they give work to people without education or respect..."

24062,20,5 months ago,3 stars,nice place but bad is that most of the time you have to wait a long time for the food and the employees are not very friendly or attentive to customers and not to mention drive thru the wait is unbearable
24063,20,a year ago,3 stars,"It is said that it is 24 hours a day but in truth it is between 8 AM and around 10 PM, I imagine it is for reasons of not having enough staff to work."
24064,20,4 years ago,1 star,"You enter the bathroom and there is no soap to wash, there is no paper to clean yourself. The hamburger is good but they deliver it to you with the black lettuce, which for me is rotten. The fries are potato fries .....

24071,20,3 years ago,2 stars,"Of all the stores of the Macdonals chain that I have visited, this is the slowest and without customer service. The lady that they must know that employee by employee number was very abusive with her way of attending, she was very closed in the explanation in the offer that she wanted, she argued that it is not her problem to explain but only to place orders, in mockery that she did not want order would cancel the order.. he fought because his service is like that... as if he was going to give me the order as a gift..."
24072,20,2 years ago,1 star,"Terrible place, dirty, bad attention, slow. And to top it off, in the middle of summer there are no frozen drinks... with a silly excuse, since it's a business with so much money, don't they have to have several machines if one breaks to replace it?... in a business like McDONALD'S, Do they not have enough staff to apply customer service as it should be?"
24073,20,3 months ago,1 star,"Very slow, too slow"
24074,20,2 years ago,1 star,"Because the first time I use this service and they did not bring me 2 ice cream that I ordered and when I called to complain they do not answer or give explanations, and my nephew whenever he orders this service from his phone says that something is always missing and I did not know why If you were like that, I would not ask for this service, now is not the time to vote for money since the work is not good."

24079,20,3 years ago,1 star,"Terrible staff in general, I have never seen a worse McDonald's in my life. Super slow, 20 minutes on the clock to pay for the order since the payment kiosks did not work, without any order, without priority to attend to the payment, without smiling, they seemed bitter at work."

There is no maintenance at all.!!!
If that is the building, how will the kitchen be?"
24082,20,3 years ago,4 stars,The employees lack customer service skills and are very slow preparing food. The self-service line was long and the attention inside was almost non-existent. The food was fine.
24083,20,2 years ago,1 star,"It wasn't good this time, they gave me a box with melted cheese and I don't know what else instead of 4 chicken nuggets. Eye check your orders well before retiring from the window"
24084,20,5 years ago,3 stars,"Ice cream... the air is so strong that it doesn't let you stay to eat something.
Orders are made with a machine... if one is a foreigner (as in my case) it is not fast enough and others wait.
I totally rescue the attention of a dispatcher ROBERT... attentive and speaks both Spanish and English... it was what best stayed in my memory..."
24085,20,7 years ago,1 star,"Very bad place. Very bad place
The manager has an agreement with tows and takes the cars from customer parking, receives bribes from the tow company.

24086,20,4 years ago,3 stars,Excellent atention. But the bathrooms are very neglected and the waste containers were completely full and there was no space for more. That part looks bad
24087,20,5 years ago,1 star,"As an uber driver and delivery person today 29 10 2017 I received a delivery from that place for a client. I stay . At zero battery, but I take a current charger that I had in the car. I went to McDonald's I asked them to let me connect in the corridor to complete my order and they told me no. It couldn't end, I lost time and money, and I'm sorry for the customer and my uber company."
24088,20,3 years ago,5 stars,"I remember this place perfectly. With my brother we went on vacation to the USA a few years ago, when we arrived at the hotel they told us that we didn't have the reservation made... We got scared!!! So we crossed paths and went to wait at this Mc. They treated us very kindly the whole time we were there. Super loving ï¿½ï"
24089,20,4 years ago,1 star,"The one who seems to be the manager today, very unprofessional. Everyone talking and playing even physically and the work behind and unattended. Only the cashier did her work, although she also seems to be a manager because she had a shirt with stripes that was different from the others."
24090,20,5 years ago,4 stars,"It is unpleasant that they are constantly towing cars in your parking lot and then the owners of the cars enter the premises claiming in an incorrect way, I understand that the parking lot is only yours for your clients like me but I think you should find another solution to this problem I think that behind all this there is a business with the grueros because I go to the place every day and on more than 10 occasions just someone parks their car and in a second the tow truck appears that they have hidden in the street behind the place, the service of the place is 5 stars I will continue visiting the place, perhaps they should make bigger signs in each parking lot that they should not leave the car in that place thanks for the opportunity of my comment because many times I have wanted to do it again thanks"
24091,20,a year ago,3 stars,"I believe that there should be more empathy with the client and guide them in their order for those who do not know the menu, a smile does not hurt anyone"
24092,20,8 years ago,1 star,"The worst experience, seeing how the supervisor denied a homeless person some fries for 25 cents. I am outraged by the lack of sensitivity on the part of the staff and seeing how they laughed at the situation! . The poor man did not go to ask or steal, he wanted to be able to eat with what he had. Shame. I will not go back to that McDonald restaurant."
24093,20,4 years ago,2 stars,"A rather dirty place, the toilets were filthy.
We waited more than 20min to be served (fast food...)
Far from being the best McDonald's we've had..."
24094,20,4 years ago,1 star,Whenever I go between 5am and 7am they always tell me the same thing that the system has gone and they don't want to sell. They should improve the attention and for that they should improve the supervision of this store
24095,20,a year ago,5 stars,"The coast is closer, so the MC is easily accessible! The shnake was delicious! The cheeseburger was also good!"
24096,20,a year ago,1 star,"The worst place, I left because it was impossible to talk to the attendant, because I don't speak English. In other places they make an effort and we understand each other but I think they discriminate against us Hispanics!!"
24097,20,3 years ago,1 star,"They are very arrogant, I took a coupon, and they gave me three options, I took the cheapest one and they sold me the most expensive one, so why offer me, and they spoke fast in English, so I couldn't understand them and, they could make fun of me"

24102,20,5 years ago,5 stars,"There is something from Mac Donald's where there is no refilling, they serve you 90% ice and 10% soda. When you tell them that it's impossible to pay to have flavored ice, they tell you that you should have asked for it without ice.... unusual...they even ask you how you want to breathe and it turns out that the customer is to blame for something they don't expect to be served."
24103,20,3 years ago,4 stars,"It's very good, during the day there are older Latina ladies who are very cool, but not at night and the place is not so nice.
